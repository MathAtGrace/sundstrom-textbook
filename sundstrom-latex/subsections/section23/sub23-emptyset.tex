\subsection*{The Empty Set}
When a set contains no elements, we say that the set is the \textbf{empty set}. 
\label{sym:empty}%
\index{empty set}%
  For example, the set of all rational numbers that are solutions of the equation $x^2 = -2$ is the empty set since this equation has no solutions that are rational numbers.  


%if the universal set is the set of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$, then the set of the predicate $x^2 - 3x - 7 = 0$ is the empty set.  This means that the statement  
%$\left( {\exists x \in \mathbb{Q}} \right)\left( {x^2  - 3x - 7 = 0} \right)$ is false.  
In mathematics, the empty set is usually designated by the symbol  $\emptyset $.  We usually read the symbol  $\emptyset $ as ``the empty set'' or ``the null set.''  (The symbol  $\emptyset $ is actually the next to last letter in the Danish-Norwegian alphabet.)
