\subsection*{Writing Guideline}\index{writing guidelines}
The proof of Proposition~\ref{P:suminduction} shows a standard way to write an induction proof.  When writing a proof by mathematical induction, you should follow the guideline that we always keep the reader informed.  This means that at the beginning of the proof, you should state that a proof by induction will be used. You should then clearly define the predicate $P ( n )$ that will be used in the proof.
