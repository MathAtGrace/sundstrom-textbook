\subsection*{Writing Guideline}
\index{writing guidelines}%
Try to use English and minimize the use of cumbersome notation.  Do not use the special symbols for quantifiers $\forall$ (for all), 
$\exists$ (there exists), $\mathrel\backepsilon$ (such that), or $\therefore $ (therefore) in formal mathematical writing.  It is often easier to write and usually easier to read, if the English words are used instead of the symbols.  For example, why make the reader interpret
\[
\left( \forall x \in \R \right) \left( \exists y \in \R \right)\left( x + y = 0 \right)
\]
when it is possible to write
\begin{center}
For each real number $x$, there exists a real number $y$ such that $x + y = 0$,
\end{center}
or, more succinctly (if appropriate),
\begin{center}
Every real number has an additive inverse.
\end{center}
