\subsection*{Other Forms of Conditional Statements}
Conditional statements
\index{conditional statement}%
\index{conditional statement!forms of}%
 are extremely important in mathematics because almost all mathematical theorems are (or can be) stated as a conditional statement in the following form:
\begin{center}
If ``certain conditions are met,'' then ``something happens.''
\end{center}
It is imperative that all students studying mathematics thoroughly understand the meaning of a conditional statement and the truth table for a conditional statement.

We also need to be aware that in the English language, there are other ways for expressing the conditional statement $P \to Q$ other than  ``If  $P$, then  $Q$.''   
Following are some common ways to express the conditional statement  $P \to Q$ in the English language:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
  \item If  $P$, then  $Q$.
  \item $P$  implies  $Q$.
  \item $P$  only if  $Q$.
\index{only if}%
  \item $Q$  if  $P$.
  \item Whenever  $P$  is true,  $Q$  is true.
  \item $Q$  is true whenever  $P$  is true.
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\begin{itemize}
  \item $Q$  is necessary
\index{necessary condition}%
 for  $P$.  
(This means that if  $P$  is true, then  $Q$  is necessarily true.)
  \item $P$  is sufficient for  $Q$.  
(This means that if you want  $Q$  to be true, it is sufficient
\index{sufficient condition}%
 to show that  $P$  is true.)
  %\item If  $P$  is true, then  $Q$  is also true.
\end{itemize}

In all of these cases,  $P$  is the \textbf{hypothesis}

 of the conditional statement and  $Q$ is the \textbf{conclusion}

 of the conditional statement.

\begin{prog}[\textbf{The ``Only If'' Statement}]\label{pr:onlyif} \hfill \\
Recall that a quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon.  Let  $S$  represent the following true conditional statement:
\begin{center}
If a quadrilateral is a square, then it is a rectangle.
\end{center}

\noindent
Write this conditional statement in English using

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}
\item the word ``whenever''

\item the phrase ``only if''

\item the phrase ``is necessary for''

\item the phrase ``is sufficient for''
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

%Now let  $T$  represent the following statement:
%\begin{center}
%A quadrilateral is a square only if it is a rectangle.
%\end{center}
%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item Is  $T$  a true statement?  Explain your reasoning.
%  \item Let  $P$  represent ``The quadrilateral is a square,'' and let  $Q$  represent ``The quadrilateral is a rectangle.''  Using  $P$  and  $Q$  and logical operators, write symbolic expressions for statements  $S$  and $T$.
%\end{enumerate}
\end{prog}
