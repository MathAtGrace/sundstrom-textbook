We introduced the concepts of open sentences and quantifiers in Section~\ref{S:predicates}. Review the definitions given on pages~\pageref{D:universal}, \pageref{D:truthset}, 
and~\pageref{D:every}.

%The following definition of a prime number is very important in many areas of mathematics.  We will use this definition at various places in the text.  It is introduced now as an example of how to work with a definition in mathematics in Activity~\ref{A:primes}.
%
%\begin{defbox}{D:prime}{A natural number  $p$  is  a \textbf{prime number}
%\index{prime number}%
% provided that it is greater than 1 and the only natural numbers that are factors of  $p$  are  1  and  $p$.  A natural number other than 1 that is not a prime number is a \textbf{composite number}.
%\index{composite number}%
%  The number 1 is neither prime nor composite.}
%\end{defbox}

%\begin{activity}[\textbf{Prime Numbers and Composite Numbers}]\label{A:primes} \hfill \\
%Using the definition of a prime number, we see that  2, 3, 5, and  7  are prime numbers.  Also, 4  is a composite number since  $4 = 2 \cdot 2$;  10 is a composite number since  $10 = 2 \cdot 5$; and 60 is a composite number since $60 = 4 \cdot 15$.
%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item Give examples of four natural numbers other than 2, 3, 5, and 7 that are prime numbers.
%  \item Explain why a natural number  $p$  that is greater than 1 is a prime number provided that
%\begin{center} For all  $d \in \mathbb{N}$, if  $d$ is a factor of $p$, then  $d = 1$  or  
%$d = p$.
%\end{center} 
%  \item Give examples of four natural numbers that are composite numbers and explain why they are composite numbers.
%  \item Write a useful description of what it means to say that a natural number is a composite number (other than saying that it is not prime).

%Let  $A$  be a subset of the real numbers.  A number  $b$  is called an \textbf{upper bound}
%\index{upper bound}%
% for the set  $A$ provided that for each element  $x$  in $A$, $x \leq b$.
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item Write this definition in symbolic form by completing the following:
%
%Let  $A$  be a subset of the real numbers.  A number  $b$  is called an upper bound for the set  $A$ provided that $ \ldots .$
%
%  \item Give examples of three different upper bounds for the set \\ 
%$A = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 1 \leq x \leq 3 \right\}$.
%
%  \item Does the set  $B = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x > 0 \right\}$ have an upper bound?  Explain.
%
%  \item Give examples of three different real numbers that are not upper bounds for the set  
%$A = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 1 \leq x \leq 3 \right\}$. \label{A:upper4}%
%
%  \item Complete the following in symbolic form:  ``Let  $A$  be a subset of $\R$.  A number  $b$  is not an upper bound for the set  $A$   provided that $ \ldots .$''
%
%  \item Without using the symbols for quantifiers, complete the following sentence:  ``Let  $A$  be a subset of $\R$.  A number  $b$  is not an upper bound for the set  $A$ provided that $ \ldots .$''  \label{A:upper6}%

%  \item Are your examples in Part~(\ref{A:upper4}) consistent with your work in 
%Part~(\ref{A:upper6})?  Explain.

%\begin{activity}[Least Upper Bound for a Subset of $\mathbb{R}$] \label{A:least}
%In Activity~\ref{A:upper}, we introduced the definition of an upper bound for a subset of the real numbers.  Assume that we know this definition and that we know what it means to say that a number is not an upper bound for a subset of the real numbers.
%
%Let  $A$  be a subset of  $\mathbb{R}$.  A real number  $\alpha $ is the \textbf{least upper bound} for  $A$  provided that  $\alpha $  is an upper bound for  $A$, and if $\beta $ is an upper bound for  $A$, then  $\alpha  \leq \beta $.
%
%\noindent
%\textbf{Note:}  The symbol  $\alpha $ is  the lowercase Greek letter alpha,  and the symbol  $\beta $ is  the lowercase Greek letter beta.
%
%If we define  $P\left( x \right)$ to be ``$x$  is an upper bound for  $A$,'' then we can write the definition for least upper bound as follows:
%
%A real number  $\alpha $ is the \textbf{least upper bound} for  $A$  provided that \\ $P\left( \alpha  \right) \wedge \left[ {\left( {\forall \beta  \in \mathbb{R}} \right)\left( {P\left( \beta  \right) \to \left( {\alpha  \leq \beta } \right)} \right)} \right]$.
%%
%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item Why is a universal quantifier used for the real number  $\beta $?
%  \item How do we negate a conjunction?
%  \item Complete the following sentence in symbolic form:  ``A real number  $\alpha $ is not the least upper bound for  $A$  provided that $ \ldots $''.
%  \item Complete the following sentence as an English sentence:  ``A real number  
%$\alpha $ is not the least upper bound for  $A$  provided that $ \ldots $''.
