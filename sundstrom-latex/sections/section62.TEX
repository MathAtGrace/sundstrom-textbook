In Section~\ref{S:introfunctions}, we have seen many examples of functions.  We have also seen various ways to represent functions and to convey information about them.  For example, we have seen that the rule for determining outputs of a function can be given by a formula, a graph, or a table of values.  We have also seen that sometimes it is more convenient to give a verbal description of the rule for a function.  In cases where the domain and codomain are small, finite sets, we used an arrow diagram to convey information about how inputs and outputs are associated without explicitly stating a rule.  In this section, we will study some types of functions, some of which we may not have encountered in previous mathematics courses.

\subsection*{Examples of Functions Using Verbal Descriptions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{The birthday function}
\index{birthday function}%
 from Preview Activity~\ref{PA:birthdayfunction}  from Section~\ref{S:introfunctions}.  
In this case,   $b$   is the function that assigns to each person his or her birthday (month and day).  The domain of the function  $b$  is the set of all people and the codomain of  $b$  is the set of all days in a leap year (i.e., January 1 through December 31, including February 29).

\item The function  \textbf{balance}  that assigns to each customer with a savings account at ManyBucksBank  the balance in that customer's savings account at the end of the business day on March 3, 2006.  The domain for this function would be the set of all savings account customers for the bank, and we could use the set of all rational numbers as the codomain.

\note  For a given function, the codomain does not have to be the same as the range.  In this case, it might be quite a hassle to determine the range.  The range would consist of all of the actual savings account balances of the customers of ManyBucksBank at the end of the business day on March 3, 2006.   We often have some freedom in selecting the codomain.  In this case, since the savings balances are monetary values given in dollars and cents, it seemed reasonable to use the set of rational numbers as the codomain.

\item The \textbf{sum of the divisors function}
\index{sum of divisors function}%
 introduced in Preview Activity~\ref{PA:sumofdivisors} from Section~\ref{S:introfunctions} and studied further in Progresss Check~\ref{pr:codomainandrange} is an example of a function that can be given by a formula, but the verbal description may be easier to understand and use.  

Recall that  $s\x \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$,  where for each  $n \in \mathbb{N}$,  
$s( n )$ is the sum of the distinct natural number divisors of  $n$.  This is a function that is studied and used in number theory, where a formula is determined for  $s\left( n \right)$
.  This formula can be written as
\[
s( n ) = \sum\limits_{d\left| n \right.} d .
\]
We do not have to worry about this notation in this text.  Basically, the formula says that  
$s( n )$ is the sum of all natural numbers  $d$,  where  $d$  divides  $n$.  Which formulation of  $s( n )$  is easier to understand?

\begin{activity}[Integration as a Function] \label{A:integration} \hfill \\
In calculus, we learned that if  $f$  is real function that is continuous on the closed interval  $\left[ {a, b} \right]$, then the definite integral  $\int_a^b {f( x ) \, dx} $ is a real number.  In fact, one form of the \textbf{Fundamental Theorem of Calculus}
\index{Fundamental Theorem!of Calculus}%
 states that
\[
\int_a^b {f( x ) \, dx} = F( b ) - F( a ),
\]
where  $F$  is any antiderivative of  $f$, that is, where  $F \,' = f$\!.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let  $\left[ {a, b} \right]$ be a closed interval of real numbers and let  
$C {\left[ {a, b} \right]} $ be the set of all real functions that are continuous on  
$\left[ {a, b} \right]$.  That is,
\[
C{\left[ {a, b} \right]}  = \left\{ {f\x \left[ {a, b} \right] \to \mathbb{R}  \mid f\text{ is continuous on }\left[ {a, b} \right]} \right\}.
\]
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain how the definite integral   $\int_a^b {f( x ) \, dx} $  can be used to define a function  $I$  from  $C{\left[ {a, b} \right]} $ to  $\mathbb{R}$.

\item Let  $\left[ {a, b} \right] = \left[ {0, 2} \right]$.  Calculate  $I( f )$,
  where  $f( x ) = x^2  + 1$.

\item Let  $\left[ {a, b} \right] = \left[ {0, 2} \right]$.  Calculate  $I( g )$,
  where  $g( x ) = \sin ( {\pi x} )$.
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{enumerate}
%
In calculus, we also learned how to determine the indefinite integral  
$\int {f( x )} \;dx$ of a continuous function  $f$.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Let  $f( x ) = x^2  + 1$ and $g(x) = \cos( 2x )$. Determine  
$\int {f( x )} \;dx$ and $\int {g( x )} \;dx$.

\item Let  $f$  be a continuous function on the closed interval  $\left[ {0, 1} \right]$
  and let  $T$  be the set of all real functions.  Can the process of determining the indefinite integral of a continuous function be used to define a function from $C{\left[ {0, 1} \right]}$ to  $T$?  Explain.

\item Another form of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that if  $f$  is continuous on the interval  $\left[ {a, b} \right]$ and if  
\[
g( x ) = \int_a^x {f( t ) \, dt}
\]
for each  $x$  in  $\left[ {a, b} \right]$, then  $g'\left( x \right) = f\left( x \right)$.  That is,  $g$  is an antiderivative of  $f$.  Explain how this theorem can be used to define a function from $C{\left[ {a,\;b} \right]} $ to  $T$\!,   where the output of the function is an antiderivative of the input.  (Recall that  $T$  is the set of all real functions.)

%\subsection*{Some Standard Functions}
%The following are examples of functions that appear frequently in many areas of mathematics.
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item \textbf{The Identity Map} \hfill
%
%Let  $A$  be a nonempty set.  The \textbf{identity map on the set}
%\index{identity map}%
%  $\boldsymbol{A}$, denoted by  $I_A $ \label{sym:idfunc}, is the function  $I_A :A \to A$ defined by  $I_A \left( x \right) = x$ for every  $x$  in  $A$.   That is, for the identity map, the output is always equal to the input.
%
%\item \textbf{Constant Functions} \hfill
%
%Any function whose range consists of a single element is called a \textbf{constant function}.
%\index{constant function}%
%\index{function!constant}%
%  This term is used because for such a function, the output is always the same.  For example, let  $A$  and  $B$  be non-empty sets, and let  $b \in B$.  The function  $f:A \to B$ defined by  $f\left( x \right) = b$ for all  $x \in A$  is a constant function.
%
%\item \textbf{The Characteristic Function of a Set} \label{charfunction} \hfill
%
%Let  $A$  be a subset of some universal set  $U$.  The \textbf{characteristic function of the set}
%\index{characteristic function}%
%\index{function!characteristic}%
%  $\boldsymbol{A}$, denoted by  $\chi _A $, \label{sym:charfunc} is the function   
%$\chi _A :U \to \left\{ {0, 1} \right\}$ defined by
%\[
%\chi _A \left( x \right) = \left\{ \begin{gathered}
%  1\text{  if  }x \in A \hfill \\
%  0\text{  if  }x \notin A \hfill \\ 
%\end{gathered}  \right.
%\]
%The symbol  $\chi $  is the lower case letter  chi  in the Greek alphabet.  The characteristic function of  $A$  maps the elements of  $A$  to the number  1  and maps the elements of  the complement of $A$  to the element  0.  
%
%If  $A$  is a subset of  $\mathbb{R}$, then we can sketch a graph of its characteristic function.  For example,  if  $A = \left[ { - 1, 2} \right]$, then its graph would be the graph shown in Figure~\ref{fig:characteristicmap}.
%%\begin{figure}[h]
%%\begin{center}
%%\includegraphics{figpscharmap.bmp}
%%\caption{Graph of Characteristic Function of $A = \left[ { - 1, 2} \right]$} \label{fig:characteristicmap}

%\end{center}
%\end{figure}
%
%\item \textbf{Projection Functions}   \hfill
%
%Let  $A$  and  $B$  be two nonempty sets.  There are two \textbf{projection functions}
%\index{projection function}%
%\index{function!projection}%
% with domain  $A \times B$, the Cartesian product of  $A$  and  $B$.  One projection function will map an ordered pair to its first coordinate, and the other projection function will map the ordered pair to its second coordinate.   So we define  \label{sym:projfunc}
%\begin{list}{}
%\item $p_1 :A \times B \to A$ by $p_1 \left( {a, b} \right) = a$ for every  
%$\left( {a, b} \right) \in A \times B$; and 
%
%\item $p_2 :A \times B \to B$  by  $p_2 \left( {a, b} \right) = b$  for every  
%$\left( {a, b} \right) \in A \times B$. 
%\end{list}
%\end{enumerate}

%\subsection*{A Function as a Set of Ordered Pairs}
%\index{function!as set of ordered pairs}%
%
%When we graph a real function, we plot ordered pairs in the Cartesian plane where the first coordinate is the input of the function and the second coordinate is the output of the function.  For example, if  $g:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, then every point on the graph of  $g$  is an ordered pair  $\left( {x, y} \right)$ of real numbers where  $y = g\left( x \right)$.  This shows how we can generate ordered pairs from a function.  It happens that we can do this with any function.
%
%For example, let  
%\[
%A = \left\{ {1, 2, 3} \right\} \text{ and } B = \left\{ {a, b} \right\}.
%\]
%Define the function  $F:A \to B$ by  
%\[
%\begin{aligned}
%  F\left( 1 \right) &= a, \\ 
%  F\left( 2 \right) &= b,\text{ and} \\ 
%  F\left( 3 \right) &= b. \\ 
%\end{aligned}
%\]
%We can convert each of these to an ordered pair in  $A \times B$ by using the input as the first coordinate and the output as the second coordinate.  For example, 
%$F\left( 1 \right) = a$ is converted to $\left( 1, a \right)$, 
%$F\left( 2 \right) = b$ is converted to $\left( 2, b \right)$, and 
%$F\left( 3 \right) = b$ is converted to $\left( 3, b \right)$.  So, we can think of this function as a set of ordered pairs, which is a subset of  $A \times B$, and write
%\[
%F = \left\{ {\left( {1, a} \right), \left( {2, b} \right), \left( {3, b} \right)} \right\}.
%\]
%In fact, any function can be represented as a set of ordered pairs.  For example, if we have a real function, such as  $g:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$  by  $g\left( x \right) = x^2  - 2$, then we can think of  $g$  as the following infinite subset of  $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$:
%\[
%g = \left\{ { {\left( {x, y} \right) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}} \mid y = x^2  - 2} \right\}.
%\]
%If the context is clear, we usually simplify this to
%\[
%g = \left\{ {\left( {x, y} \right)} \mid y = x^2  - 2 \right\} \quad \text{ or } \quad
%g = \left\{ {\left( {x, x^2 - 2} \right)} \mid x \in \mathbb{R} \right\}.
%\]
%\hbreak
%%
%\begin{activity}[Defining a Function as a Set of Ordered Pairs] \label{A:funcasorderedparis} \hfill
%
%So far, we have started with a function and generated a set of ordered pairs that we can use to represent the function.  It is possible to reverse this process and first define a function as a special type of set of ordered pairs.  For example, if we started with  
%$A = \left\{ {1, 2, 3} \right\}$, $B = \left\{ {a, b} \right\}$, and defined
%\[
%F = \left\{ {\left( {1, a} \right), \left( {2, b} \right), \left( {3, b} \right)} \right\} \subseteq A \times B,
%\]
%then we could think of  $F$  as a function from  $A$  to  $B$  with  
%\[
%\begin{aligned}
%F\left( 1 \right) &= a, \\
%F\left( 2 \right) &= b, \text{ and} \\
%F\left( 3 \right) &= b. \\
%\end{aligned}
%\]
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Could we use the following subset of  $A \times B$ to define a function from  $A$  to  $B$?  Explain.  \label{A:funcasorderedparis1}
%\[
%f = \left\{ {\left( {1, a} \right), \left( {2, a} \right), \left( {3, a} \right), \left( {1, b} \right)} \right\}
%\]
%
%\item Could we use the following subset of  $A \times B$ to define a function from  $A$  to  $B$?  Explain.   \label{A:funcasorderedparis2}
%\[
%g = \left\{ {\left( {1, a} \right), \left( {2, b} \right), \left( {3, a} \right)} \right\}
%\]
%
%\item Could we use the following subset of  $A \times B$
% to define a function from  $A$  to  $B$?  Explain.  \label{A:funcasorderedparis3}
%\[
%h = \left\{ {\left( {1, a} \right), \left( {2, b} \right)} \right\}
%\]
%
%\end{enumerate}
%
%In Section~\ref{S:introfunctions}, we defined a function  $f$   from a set  $A$  to a set  $B$  to be a rule that associates with every element  $x$  of the set  $A$  exactly one element of the set  $B$. 
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\setcounter{enumi}{3}
%\item Carefully reformulate the definition of a function  $f$   from a set  $A$  to a set  $B$  to be a set of ordered pairs that is a subset of  $A \times B$  that has some clearly defined property or properties.  The examples in Parts~(\ref{A:funcasorderedparis1}) through~(\ref{A:funcasorderedparis3}) may be of help in specifying these properties.  
%
%This definition should be equivalent to the definition of a function given in Section~\ref{S:introfunctions}.  This means that a function as defined in Section~\ref{S:introfunctions} should produce a subset of  $A \times B$  with the specified properties, and a subset of  $A \times B$  with the specified properties could be used to define a function with the first coordinate as the input and the second coordinate as the output.
%
%\end{enumerate}
%
%\noindent
%\underline{Note}:  Many mathematicians believe that this ordered pair representation of a function is the most rigorous definition of a function.  It allows us to use set theory to work with and compare functions.  For example, equality of functions becomes a question of equality of sets.  Therefore, many textbooks will use the ordered pair representation of a function as the definition of a function.
