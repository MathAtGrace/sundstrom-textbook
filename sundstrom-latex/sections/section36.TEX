\section{Review of Proof Methods} \label{S:reviewproofs}
\setcounter{previewactivity}{0}
This section is different from others in the text.  It is meant primarily as a review of the proof methods studied in Chapter~\ref{C:proofs}.  So the first part of the section will be a description of some of the main proof techniques introduced in Chapter~\ref{C:proofs}.  The most important part of this section is the set of exercises since these exercises will provide an opportunity to use the proof techniques that we have studied so far.

%There are two activies in this section that deal with so-called ``divisibility tests.''  
%\index{divisibility test}%
%A \textbf{divisibility test} gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a natural number to be divisible by another natural number.  For example, we often say that a natural number $n$ is divisible by 2 if and only if the units digit in the decimal representation of $n$ is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.  The proof of this divisibility test is included in the exercises.  
%
%The two activities in this section are considered optional in the sense that skipping them will not affect the development of the material in the rest of the book.

We will now give descriptions of three of the most common methods used to prove a conditional statement.
