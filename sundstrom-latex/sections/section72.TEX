\begin{activity}[\textbf{Examples of Relations with Certain Properties}] \label{A:examplesofrelations} \hfill \\
Let  $A = \left\{ {1, 2, 3, 4} \right\}$.  We can define relations on the set  $A$  by simply listing the ordered pairs in the relation, and we can use digraphs to represent the relations.  For example, a relation on  $A$  that is reflexive on  $A$  but not symmetric and not transitive is  the relation in Part~(\ref{PA:directedgraphs1}) of Preview Activity~\ref{PA:directedgraphs}.  This relation is
\[
R = \left\{ {( {1, 1} ), ( {2, 2} ), ( {3, 3} ), ( {4, 4} ), ( {1, 3} ), ( {3, 2} )} \right\}.  
\]
\begin{itemize}
\item This relation is reflexive on  $A$  because  $\left( {x, x} \right) \in R$ for every  
$x \in A$. 

\item This relation is not symmetric since  $\left( {1, 3} \right) \in R$ but  
$\left( {3, 1} \right) \notin R$.  

\item This relation is not transitive since  $\left( {1, 3} \right) \in R$ and  
$\left( {3, 2} \right) \in R$, but  
\linebreak
$\left( {1, 2} \right) \notin R$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain why  $R = \left\{ {\left( {1, 2} \right), \left( {2, 1} \right)} \right\}$
is a relation on  $A$  that is symmetric but not reflexive on  $A$  and not transitive .

\item Find a relation on $A$  that is transitive but neither reflexive on  $A$  nor symmetric.

\item Find a relation on $A$  that is reflexive on  $A$  and symmetric but not transitive.

\item Find a relation on $A$  that is reflexive on  $A$  and transitive but not symmetric.

\item Find a relation on $A$  that is symmetric and transitive but not reflexive on  $A$.
\end{enumerate}

The relations in this activity show that the three properties (reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity) are independent of each other in the sense that it is possible to construct a relation that satisfies any one of the properties but not the other two.  It is also possible to construct a relation that satisfies any two of the properties but not the third.
