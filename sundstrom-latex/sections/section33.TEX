%\begin{proposition}\label{P:contradiction}
%For all real numbers  $x$  and  $y$, if  $x \ne y$, $x > 0$, and $y > 0$, then  
%$\dfrac{x}{y} + \dfrac{y}{x} > 2.$
%\end{proposition}
%%
%\begin{myproof}
%This proposition will be proved using a proof by contradiction.  So we assume that there exist real numbers $x$  and  $y$  such that  $x \ne y$, $x > 0,\text{ and }y > 0$  and that
%
%\[
%\frac{x}
%{y} + \frac{y}{x} \leq 2.
%\]
%
%
%Since  $x$  and  $y$  are positive, we can multiply both sides of this inequality by  $xy$  to obtain
%
%\[
%x^2  + y^2  \leq 2xy.
%\]
%
%
%We will obtain a contradiction using the assumption that  $x \ne y$.  Using basic algebra, it is seen that
%\begin{align}
%  x^2  - 2xy + y^2  &\leq 0 \notag \\ 
%  \left( {x - y} \right)^2  &\leq 0. 
%  \label{eq:3f}% 
%\end{align} 
%However, one of the assumptions we made was that  $x \ne y$.  This implies that  $x - y \ne 0$
% and hence that
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:3g}
%\left( {x - y} \right)^2  > 0.
%\end{equation}
%
%Inequalities~(\ref{eq:3f})  and (\ref{eq:3g})   cannot both be true, and so we have obtained a contradiction.  Thus, our given statement cannot be false and we have proven that if  $x \ne y$, $x > 0,\text{ and }y > 0$, then  $\dfrac{x}{y} + \dfrac{y}{x} > 2$.

%Consider the following proposition:

%  \item Let  $a$, $b$, and $c$  be integers.  If  3  divides  $a$,  3  divides  $b$,  and  $c \equiv 1 \pmod 3$, then the equation

%\noindent 
%\textbf{\emph{Proof.}}  A proof by contradiction will be used.  So we assume that the statement is false.  That is, we assume that there exists integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that 3  divides both  $a$  and  $b$, that  $c \equiv 1 \pmod 3$,  and that  the equation
%\[
%ax + by = c
%\]
%has a solution in which both  $x$  and  $y$  are integers.
%So there exist integers  $m$  and  $n$  such that 
%\[
%am  + bn  = c.
%\]
%\hint  Now use the facts that  3  divides  $a$, 3  divides  $b$, and  
%$c \equiv 1 \pmod 3$.

%\begin{activity}[Exploring a Quadratic Equation]\label{A:quadratic} \hfill \\
%Consider the following proposition:
%\begin{list}{}
%  \item For all integers $m$ and $n$, if $n$ is odd, then the equation
%   \[
%   x^2+2mx+2n=0
%   \]
%   has no integer solution for $x$.
%\end{list}
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item What are the solutions of the equation  when  $m = 1$ and $n =  - 1$?  That is, what are the solutions of the equation  $x^2  + 2x - 2 = 0$?
%
%  \item What are the solutions of the equation  when  $m = 2$ and $n = 3$?  That is, what are the solutions of the equation  $x^2  + 4x + 2 = 0$?
%
% % \item What are the solutions of the equation  when  $m = 1$ and $n = 3$?  That is, what are the solutions of the equation  $x^2  + 2x + 6 = 0$?
%
%  \item Solve the resulting quadratic equation for at least two more examples using values of  
%$m$  and  $n$  that satisfy the hypothesis of the proposition.
%
%  \item For this proposition, why does it seem reasonable to try a proof by contradiction?
%
%  \item For this proposition, state clearly the assumptions that need to be made at the beginning of a proof by contradiction.
%
%  \item Use a proof by contradiction to prove this proposition.
