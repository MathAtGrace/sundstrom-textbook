\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider the following statement written in symbolic form:\\  $\left( {\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}} \right)\left( {x\text{ is a multiple of 2}} \right)$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Write this statement as an English sentence.
    \item Is the statement true or false?  Why?
    \item How would you write the negation of this statement as an English sentence?
    \item If possible, write your negation of this statement from part~(2) symbolically (using a quantifier).
  \end{enumerate}
