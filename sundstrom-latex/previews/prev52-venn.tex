\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw a Venn diagram for two sets, $A$  and  $B$, with the assumption that  $A$ is a subset of $B$.  On this Venn diagram, lightly shade the area corresponding to  $A^c $.  Then, determine the region on the Venn diagram that corresponds to  $B^c $.  What appears to be the relationship between   $A^c $  and   $B^c $?  Explain.

\item Draw a general Venn diagram for two sets, $A$  and  $B$.  First determine the region that corresponds to the set $A - B$ and then, on the Venn diagram, shade the region corresponding to  $A - (A - B)$  and  shade the region corresponding to  $A \cap B$.  What appears to be the relationship between these two sets?  Explain.
