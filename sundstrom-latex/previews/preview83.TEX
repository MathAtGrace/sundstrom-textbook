\begin{enumerate}
\item Notice that $x = 2$ and $y = 1$ is a solution of the equation 
$3x + 5y = 11$, and that $x = 7$ and $y = -2$ is also a solution of the equation 
$3x + 5y = 11$.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find two pairs of integers $x$ and $y$ so that $x > 7$ and 
%\linebreak
$3x + 5y = 11$.  (Try to keep the integer values of $x$ as small as possible.)

  \item Find two pairs of integers $x$ and $y$ so that $x < 2$ and 
%\linebreak
$3x + 5y = 11$.  (Try to keep the integer values of $x$ as close to 2 as possible.)

  \item Determine formulas (one for $x$ and one for $y$)  that will generate pairs of integers $x$ and $y$ so that $3x + 5y = 11$.

\hint  The two formulas can be written in the form $x = 2 + km$ and $y = 1 + kn$, where $k$ is an arbitrary integer and $m$ and $n$ are specific integers. 

\end{enumerate}

\item Notice that $x = 4$ and $y = 0$ is a solution of the equation $4x + 6y = 16$, and that 
$x = 7$ and $y = -2$ is a solution of the equation $4x + 6y = 16$.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find two pairs of integers $x$ and $y$ so that $x > 7$ and 
%\linebreak
$4x + 6y = 16$.  (Try to keep the integer values of $x$ as small as possible.)

  \item Find twopairs of integers $x$ and $y$ so that $x < 4$ and 
%\linebreak
$4x + 6y = 16$.  (Try to keep the integer values of $x$ as close to 4 as possible.)
