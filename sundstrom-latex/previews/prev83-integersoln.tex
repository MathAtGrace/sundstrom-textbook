\item Does the linear equation $4x = 9$ have a solution that is an integer?  Explain.
\item Does the linear equation $-3x = 20$ have a solution that is an integer?  Explain.


\item Prove the following theorem:

\begin{theorem}\label{prop:lindiophone}%
Let $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $a \ne 0$. 

\begin{itemize}
\item If $a$ divides $b$, then the equation $ax = b$ has exactly one solution that is an integer.
\item If $a$ does not divide $b$, then the equation $ax = b$ has no solution that is an integer.  
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
