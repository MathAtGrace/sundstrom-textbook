\begin{previewactivity}[Systems of Linear Equations] \label{PA:linearsystems} \hfill

If $x$ and $y$ represent real numbers, solve each of the following systems of two linear equations in two unknowns:
\begin{align} 
  \textbf{1.  } 3x+5y &= 1   &  \textbf{2.  } 2x-5y &=1  &  \textbf{3.  } 2x-5y &=1 \notag  \\
                7x-y  &= 15  &               -4x+10y &= 2 &              -4x+10y &=-2 \notag  \\
\notag

\begin{previewactivity}[Intersections of Circles] \label{PA:circles} \hfill

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R} $ and let $r$ be a positive real number.  Then the graph of an equation of the form 
\[
\left( {x-a} \right)^2 + \left( {y-b} \right)^2 = r^2
\]
is a circle with center at the point $ \left( a,b \right)$ and radius $r$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Using an appropriate pair of coordinate axes, carefully draw the graphs of the circles given by the following two equations. 
\[
\begin{aligned}
                       x^2  + y^2  &= 4 \\ 
  \left( {x - 3} \right)^2  + y^2  &= 4 \\ 
\end{aligned}
\]
Then solve the system of two equations in two unknowns to find all points of intersection of the two circles.
