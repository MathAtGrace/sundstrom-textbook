\item Statements (a), (c), and (d) are true.

\item (a) True when $a \ne 3$.  (b) True when $a= 3$.


\item In Part (c), the instructor would have lied.  Part (b) corresponds to the first row of the truth table for $P \to Q$ , Part (c) corresponds to the second row, and Part (d) corresponds to the last row of this truth table.

\item Some possible conjectures are:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $n$ is a natural number, then the units digit of $4^n$ must be 4 or 6.
\item The units digit of the successive powers of 4 alternate between 4 and 6.
\item If $n$ is an odd natural number, then the units of digit of $4^n$ is 4, and if $n$ is an even natural number, then the units of digit of $4^n$ is 6.
\end{itemize}

\item If $n$ is a natural number, then the units digit of $\left( 7^n - 2^n \right)$ is 5.

\item If $f(x) = e^{2x}$, then:
\begin{multicols}{3}
$f'(x) = 2e^{2x}$

$f''(x) = 2^2 e^{2x}$

$f'''(x) = 2^3 e^{2x}$

$f^{(4)}(x) = 2^4 e^{2x}$

$f^{(5)}(x) = 2^5 e^{2x}$

$f^{(6)}(x) = 2^6 e^{2x}$
