<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The symbol \(\in\) is used to describe a relationship between an element of the universal set and a subset of the universal set, and the symbol \(\subseteq\) is used to describe a relationship between two subsets of the universal set. For example, the number 5 is an integer, and so it is appropriate to write \(5 \in \mathbb{Z}\text{.}\) It is not appropriate, however, to write \(5 \subseteq \mathbb{Z}\) since 5 is not a set. It is important to distinguish between 5 and \(\left\{ 5 \right\}\text{.}\) The difference is that 5 is an integer and \(\left\{ 5 \right\}\) is a set consisting of one element. Consequently, it is appropriate to write \(\left\{ 5 \right\} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}\text{,}\) but it is not appropriate to write \(\left\{ 5 \right\} \in \mathbb{Z}\text{.}\) The distinction between these two symbols \(\left( 5 \text{ and } \left\{ 5 \right\} \right)\) is important when we discuss what is called the power set of a given set.</p>
