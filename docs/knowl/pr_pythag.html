<p>The <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">Pythagorean Theorem</dfn>  for right triangles states that if \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle and \(c\) is the length of the hypotenuse, then \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\) For example, if \(a = 5\) and \(b = 12\) are the lengths of the two sides of a right triangle and if \(c\) is the length of the hypotenuse, then the \(c^2 = 5^2 + 12^2\) and so \(c^2 = 169\text{.}\) Since \(c\) is a length and must be positive, we conclude that \(c = 13\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Construct and provide a well-written proof for the following proposition. <blockquote class="blockquote">Proposition: If \(m\) is a real number and \(m\text{,}\) \(m + 1\text{,}\) and \(m + 2\) are the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle, then \(m = 3\text{.}\)</blockquote></p>
<p>Although this proposition uses different mathematical concepts than the one used in this section, the process of constructing a proof for this proposition is the same forward-backward method that was used to construct a proof for <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_xyodd.html" title="Theorem 1.15">Theorem 1.15</a>. However, the backward question, “How do we prove that \(m = 3\text{?}\)” is simple but may be difficult to answer. The basic idea is to develop an equation from the forward process and show that \(m = 3\) is a solution of that equation.</p>
