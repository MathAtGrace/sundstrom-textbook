<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><em class="emphasis">Constructing appropriate examples is extremely important</em>. Exploration often requires looking at lots of examples. In this way, we can gather information that provides evidence that a statement is true, or we might find an example that shows the statement is false. This type of example is called a <dfn class="terminology">counterexample</dfn>. </p>
<p>For example, if someone makes the conjecture that \(\sin \! \left(2x \right) = 2 \sin (x)\text{,}\) for all real numbers \(x\text{,}\) we can test this conjecture by substituting specific values for \(x\text{.}\) One way to do this is to choose values of \(x\) for which \(\sin (x)\) is known. Using \(x = \dfrac{\pi}{4}\text{,}\) we see that</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}\sin \! \left( 2 \left( \frac{\pi}{4} \right) \right) \amp = \sin 
\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1, \text{ and }  \\ 2 \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \amp = 
2 \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2}. \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Since \(1 \ne \sqrt{2}\text{,}\) these calculations show that this conjecture is false. However, if we do not find a counterexample for a conjecture, we usually cannot claim the conjecture is true. The best we can say is that our examples indicate the conjecture is true. As an example, consider the conjecture that <blockquote class="blockquote">If \(x\) and \(y\) are odd integers, then \(x + y\) is an even integer.</blockquote> We can do lots of calculations, such as \(3 + 7 = 10\) and \(5 + 11 = 16\text{,}\) and find that every time we add two odd integers, the sum is an even integer. However, it is not possible to test every pair of odd integers, and so we can only say that the conjecture appears to be true. (We will prove that this statement is true in the next section.)</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="S_1prop.html#paragraphs-8">in-context</a></span>
