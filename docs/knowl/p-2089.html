<p>The statement \(P \to Q\) is either true or false. In a proof by contradiction, we show that it is true by eliminating the only other possibility (that it is false). We show that \(P \to Q\) cannot be false by assuming it is false and reaching a contradiction. Since we assume that \(P \to Q\) is false, and the only way for a conditional statement to be false is for its hypothesis to be true and its conclusion to be false, we assume that \(P\) is true and that \(Q\) is false (or, equivalently, that \(\mynot Q\) is true). When we reach a contradiction, we know that our original assumption that \(P \to Q\) is false is incorrect. Hence, \(P \to Q\) cannot be false, and so it must be true.</p>
