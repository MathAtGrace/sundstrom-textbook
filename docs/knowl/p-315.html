<p>We now focus our effort on proving statement \(Q1\) since we know that if we can prove \(Q1\text{,}\) then we can conclude that \(Q\) is true. We ask a backward question about \(Q1\) such as, “How can we prove that there exists an integer \(q\) such that \(x \cdot y = 2q + 1\text{?}\)” We may not have a ready answer for this question, and so we look at the know portion of the table and try to connect the know portion to the show portion. To do this, we work forward from step \(P\text{,}\) and this involves asking a <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">forward question.</dfn>  The basic form of this type of question is, “What can we conclude from the fact that \(P\) is true?” In this case, we can use the definition of an odd integer to conclude that there exist integers \(m\) and \(n\) such that \(x = 2m + 1\) and \(y = 2n + 1\text{.}\) We will call this Step \(P1\) in the know-show table. It is important to notice that we were careful not to use the letter \(q\) to denote these integers. If we had used \(q\) again, we would be claiming that the same integer that gives \(x \cdot y = 2q + 1\) also gives \(x = 2q + 1\text{.}\) This is why we used \(m\) and \(n\) for the integers \(x\) and \(y\) since there is no guarantee that \(x\) equals \(y\text{.}\) The basic rule of thumb is to use a different symbol for each new object we introduce in a proof. So at this point, we have: <blockquote class="blockquote">Step \(P1\text{.}\) We know that there exist integers \(m\) and \(n\) such that \(x = 2m + 1\) and \(y = 2n + 1\text{.}\)</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">Step \(Q1\text{.}\) We need to prove that there exists an integer \(q\) such that \(x \cdot y = 2q + 1\text{.}\)</blockquote></p>
