<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">This type of proof is often used when the hypothesis and the conclusion are both stated in a “positive” manner. That is, no negations are evident in the hypothesis and conclusion.</p>

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Assume that \(P\) is true and use this to conclude that \(Q\) is true. That is, we use the forward-backward method and work forward from \(P\) and backward from \(Q\text{.}\)</p>

<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Why the process makes sense.</span></h6>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We know that the conditional statement \(P \to Q\) is automatically true when the hypothesis is false. Therefore, because our goal is to prove that \(P \to Q\) is true, there is nothing to do in the case that \(P\) is false. Consequently, we may assume that \(P\) is true. Then, in order for \(P \to Q\) to be true, the conclusion \(Q\) must also be true. (When \(P\) is true, but \(Q\) is false, \(P \to Q\) is false.) Thus, we must use our assumption that \(P\) is true to show that \(Q\) is also true.</p>
