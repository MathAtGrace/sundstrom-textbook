<p>We will use a proof by contradiction. So we assume that there exist real numbers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x\) is rational, \(x \ne 0\text{,}\) \(y\) is irrational, and \(x \cdot y\) is rational. Since \(x \ne 0\text{,}\) we can divide by \(x\text{,}\) and since the rational numbers are closed under division by nonzero rational numbers, we know that \(\dfrac{1}{x} \in \Q\text{.}\) We now know that \(x \cdot y\) and \(\dfrac{1}{x}\) are rational numbers and since the rational numbers are closed under multiplication, we conclude that</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{x} \cdot \left( xy \right) \in \Q\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>However, \(\dfrac{1}{x} \cdot \left( xy \right) = y\) and hence, \(y\) must be a rational number. Since a real number cannot be both rational and irrational, this is a contradiction to the assumption that \(y\) is irrational. We have therefore proved that for all real numbers \(x\) and \(y\text{,}\) if \(x\) is rational and \(x \ne 0\) and \(y\) is irrational, then \(x \cdot y\) is irrational. \(\blacksquare\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_contradiction.html#proof-10">in-context</a></span>
