<p>As we saw in <a href="S_1prop.html#PA_prop" class="internal" title="Beginning Activity: Beginning Activity 1: Statements">Beginning Activity 1</a>, some sentences that are mathematical in nature often are not statements because we may not know precisely what a variable represents. Following are some more examples</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<p>There exists a real number \(x\) such that \(x+7 = 10\text{.}\)</p>
<p>This is a statement because either such a real number exists or such a real number does not exist. In this case, this is a true statement since such a real number does exist, namely \(x = 3\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each real number \(x\text{,}\) \(2x + 5 = 2\left(x + \dfrac{5}{2} \right)\text{.}\)</p>
<p>This is a statement since either the sentence \(2x + 5 = 2\left(x + \dfrac{5}{2} \right)\) is true when any real number is substituted for \(x\) (in which case, the statement is true) or there is at least one real number that can be substituted for \(x\) and produce a false statement (in which case, the statement is false). In this case, the given statement is true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solve the equation \(x^2 - 7x + 10 = 0\text{.}\)</p>
<p>This is not a statement since it is a directive. It does not assert that something is true.</p>
</li>
<li><p>\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2\) is not a statement since it is not known what \(a\) and \(b\) represent. However, the sentence, “There exist real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2\)” is a statement. In fact, this is a true statement since there are such integers. For example, if \(a = 1\) and \(b = 0\text{,}\) then \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Compare the statement in the previous item to the statement, “For all real numbers \(a\) and \(b\text{,}\) \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2\text{.}\)” This is a false statement since there are values for \(a\) and \(b\) for which \((a + b)^2 \ne a^2 + b^2\text{.}\) For example, if \(a = 2\) and \(b = 3\text{,}\) then \((a + b)^2 = 5^2 = 25\) and \(a^2 + b^2 = 2^2 + 3^2 = 13\)</p></li>
</ul>
