<p>Suppose that I say <blockquote class="blockquote">If it is not raining, then Daisy is riding her bike.</blockquote> We can represent this conditional statement as <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> where <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is the statement, “It is not raining” and <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is the statement, “Daisy is riding her bike.”</p>
<p>Although it is not a perfect analogy, think of the statement <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> as being <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">false</em> to mean that I lied and think of the statement <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> as being <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">true</em> to mean that I did not lie. We will now check the truth value of <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> based on the truth values of <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span></p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Suppose that both <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> are true. That is, it is not raining and Daisy is riding her bike. In this case, it seems reasonable to say that I told the truth and that <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is true and <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is false or that it is not raining and Daisy is not riding her bike. It would appear that by making the statement, “If it is not raining, then Daisy is riding her bike,” I have not told the truth. So in this case, the statement <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> is false.</p></li>
<li><p>Now suppose that <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is false and <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true or that it is raining and Daisy is riding her bike. Did I make a false statement by stating that if it is not raining, then Daisy is riding her bike? The key is that I did not make any statement about what would happen if it was raining, and so I did not tell a lie. So we consider the conditional statement, “If it is not raining, then Daisy is riding her bike,” to be true in the case where it is raining and Daisy is riding her bike.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, suppose that both <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> are false. That is, it is raining and Daisy is not riding her bike. As in the previous situation, since my statement was <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(P \to Q\text{,}\)</span> I made no claim about what would happen if it was raining, and so I did not tell a lie. So the statement <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> cannot be false in this case and so we consider it to be true.</p></li>
