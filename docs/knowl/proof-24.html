<p>We will use the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction. We let \(P( n )\) be \(n\) is a prime number or \(n\) is a product of prime numbers.</p>
<p>For the basis step, \(P ( 2 )\) is true since 2 is a prime number.</p>
<p>To prove the inductive step, we let \(k\) be a natural number with \(k \geq 2\text{.}\) We assume that \(P( 2 ),P( 3 ), \ldots ,P( k )\) are true. That is, we assume that each of the natural numbers \(2,3, \ldots ,k\) is a prime number or a product of prime numbers. The goal is to prove that \(P( {k + 1} )\) is true or that \((k + 1)\) is a prime number or a product of prime numbers.</p>
<p>Case 1: If \(\left( {k + 1} \right)\) is a prime number, then \(P( {k + 1} )\) is true.</p>
<p>Case 2: If \(\left( {k + 1} \right)\) is not a prime number, then \(\left( {k + 1} \right)\) can be factored into a product of natural numbers with each one being less than \(\left( {k + 1} \right)\text{.}\) That is, there exist natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\) with</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
k + 1 = a \cdot b,  \text{ and }   1 \lt  a \leq k \text{ and }   1 \lt  b \leq k\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Using the inductive assumption, this means that \(P( a )\) and \(P( b )\) are both true. Consequently, \(a\) and \(b\) are prime numbers or are products of prime numbers. Since \(k + 1 = a \cdot b\text{,}\) we conclude that \(\left( {k + 1} \right)\) is a product of prime numbers. That is, we conclude that \(P\left( {k + 1} \right)\) is true. This proves the inductive step.</p>
<p>Hence, by the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction, we conclude that \(P( n )\) is true for all \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) with \(n \geq 2\text{,}\) and this means that each natural number greater than 1 is either a prime number or is a product of prime numbers. \(\blacksquare\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_otherinduction.html#proof-24">in-context</a></span>
