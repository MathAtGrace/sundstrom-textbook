<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In order for the set of natural numbers to be closed under subtraction, the following conditional statement would have to be true: If \(x\) and \(y\) are natural numbers, then \(x - y\) is a natural number. However, since 5 and 8 are natural numbers, \(5 - 8 = -3\text{,}\) which is not a natural number, this conditional statement is false. Therefore, the set of natural numbers is not closed under subtraction.</p>
<p>We can use the rules for multiplying fractions and the closure rules for the integers to show that the rational numbers are closed under multiplication. If \(\dfrac{a}{b}\) and \(\dfrac{c}{d}\) are rational numbers (so \(a\text{,}\) \(b\text{,}\) \(c\text{,}\) and \(d\) are integers and \(b\) and \(d\) are not zero), then</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Since the integers are closed under multiplication, we know that \(ac\) and \(bd\) are integers and since \(b \ne 0\) and \(d \ne 0\text{,}\) \(bd \ne 0\text{.}\) So \(\dfrac{ac}{bd}\) is a rational number and this shows that the rational numbers are closed under multiplication.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_1prop.html#ex_closure">in-context</a></span>
