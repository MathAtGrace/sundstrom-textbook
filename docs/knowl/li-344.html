<p>We will prove this proposition using mathematical induction. For each natural number \(n\text{,}\) we let \(P( n )\) be</p>
<p>Any set of \(n\) dogs consists entirely of dogs of the same breed.</p>
<p>We will prove that for each natural number \(n\text{,}\) \(P( n )\) is true, which will prove that all dogs are the same breed. A set with only one dog consists entirely of dogs of the same breed and, hence, \(P( 1 )\) is true.</p>
<p>So we let \(k\) be a natural number and assume that \(P( k )\) is true, that is, that every set of \(k\) dogs consists of dogs of the same breed. Now consider a set \(D\) of \(k + 1\) dogs, where</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
D = \left\{ d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k, d_{k+1} \right\}\!\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>If we remove the dog \(d_1\) from the set \(D\text{,}\) we then have a set \(D_1\) of \(k\) dogs, and using the assumption that \(P( k )\) is true, these dogs must all be of the same breed. Similarly, if we remove \(d_{k+1}\) from the set \(D\text{,}\) we again have a set \(D_2\) of \(k\) dogs, and these dogs must all be of the same breed. Since \(D = D_1 \cup D_2\text{,}\) we have proved that all of the dogs in \(D\) must be of the same breed.</p>
<p>This proves that if \(P( k )\) is true, then \(P( k + 1 )\) is true and, hence, by mathematical induction, we have proved that for each natural number \(n\text{,}\) any set of \(n\) dogs consists entirely of dogs of the same breed.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_mathinduction.html#li-344">in-context</a></span>
