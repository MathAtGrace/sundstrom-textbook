<p>Sometimes, we must be aware of conventions that are being used. In most calculus texts, the convention is that any function has a domain and a range that are subsets of the real numbers. In addition, when we say something like “the function \(f\) is differentiable at \(a\)”, it is understood that \(a\) is a real number. With these conventions, the following statement is a true statement, which is proven in many calculus texts. <blockquote class="blockquote">If the function \(f\) is differentiable at \(a\text{,}\) then the function \(f\) is continuous at \(a\text{.}\)</blockquote> Using only this true statement, is it possible to make a conclusion about the function in each of the following cases?</p>
