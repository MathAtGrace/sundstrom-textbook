<p>We will use a proof by contradiction. We assume that there are only finitely many primes, and let</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
p_1 , p_2 ,  \ldots , p_m
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">be the list of all the primes. Let</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
M = p_1 p_2  \cdots p_m  + 1 \qquad (1)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Notice that \(M \ne 1\text{.}\) So \(M\) is either a prime number or, by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, \(M\) is a product of prime numbers. In either case, \(M\) has a factor that is a prime number. Since we have listed all the prime numbers, this means that there exists a natural number \(j\) with \(1 \leq j \leq m\) such that \(p_j \mid  M\text{.}\) Now, we can rewrite equation (1) as follows:</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
1 = M - p_1 p_2  \cdots p_m \qquad (2)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We have proved \(p_j \mid M\text{,}\) and since \(p_j\) is one of the prime factors of \(p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m\text{,}\) we can also conclude that \(p_j \mid \left( {p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m } \right)\text{.}\) Since \(p_j\) divides both of the terms on the right side of equation (2), we can use this equation to conclude that \(p_j\) divides 1. This is a contradiction since a prime number is greater than 1 and cannot divide 1. Hence, our assumption that there are only finitely many primes is false, and so there must be infinitely many primes.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_primefactorizations.html#proof-50">in-context</a></span>
