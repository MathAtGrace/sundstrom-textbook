<p>Although it is not a perfect analogy, think of the statement \(P \to Q\) as being <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">false</em> to mean that I lied and think of the statement \(P \to Q\) as being <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">true</em> to mean that I did not lie. We will now check the truth value of \(P \to Q\) based on the truth values of \(P\) and \(Q\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Suppose that both \(P\) and \(Q\) are true. That is, it is not raining and Daisy is riding her bike. In this case, it seems reasonable to say that I told the truth and that \(P \to Q\) is true.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that \(P\) is true and \(Q\) is false or that it is not raining and Daisy is not riding her bike. It would appear that by making the statement, “If it is not raining, then Daisy is riding her bike,” I have not told the truth. So in this case, the statement \(P \to Q\) is false.</p></li>
<li><p>Now suppose that \(P\) is false and \(Q\) is true or that it is raining and Daisy is riding her bike. Did I make a false statement by stating that if it is not raining, then Daisy is riding her bike? The key is that I did not make any statement about what would happen if it was raining, and so I did not tell a lie. So we consider the conditional statement, “If it is not raining, then Daisy is riding her bike,” to be true in the case where it is raining and Daisy is riding her bike.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, suppose that both \(P\) and \(Q\) are false. That is, it is raining and Daisy is not riding her bike. As in the previous situation, since my statement was \(P \to Q\text{,}\) I made no claim about what would happen if it was raining, and so I did not tell a lie. So the statement \(P \to Q\) cannot be false in this case and so we consider it to be true.</p></li>
