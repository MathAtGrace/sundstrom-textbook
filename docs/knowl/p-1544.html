<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Another method of proof that is frequently used in mathematics is a <dfn class="terminology">proof by contradiction.</dfn>  This method is based on the fact that a statement \(X\) can only be true or false (and not both). The idea is to prove that the statement \(X\) is true by showing that it cannot be false. This is done by assuming that \(X\) is false and proving that this leads to a contradiction. (The contradiction often has the form \(\left( {R \wedge \mynot R} \right)\text{,}\) where \(R\) is some statement.) When this happens, we can conclude that the assumption that the statement \(X\) is false is incorrect and hence \(X\) cannot be false. Since it cannot be false, then \(X\) must be true.</p>
