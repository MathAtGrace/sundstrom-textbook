<p>Player One has a 6 by 6 array to complete and Player Two has a 1 by 6 row to complete. Each player has six turns as described next.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Player One begins by filling in the first horizontal row of his or her table with a sequence of six X's and O's, one in each square in the first row.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Then Player Two places either an X or an O in the first box of his or her row. At this point, Player One has completed the first row and Player Two has filled in the first box of his or her row with one letter.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The game continues with Player One completing a row with six letters (X's and O's), one in each box of the next row followed by Player Two writing one letter (an X or an O) in the next box of his or her row. The game is completed when Player One has completed all six rows and Player Two has completed all six boxes in his or her row.</p></li>
