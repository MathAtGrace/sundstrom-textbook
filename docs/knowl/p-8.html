<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">This book is designed not to be just casually read but rather to be <em class="emphasis">engaged</em>. It may seem like a clich√© (because it is in almost every mathematics book now) but there is truth in the statement that <em class="emphasis">mathematics is not a spectator sport</em>. To learn and understand mathematics, you must <em class="emphasis">engage</em> in the process of doing mathematics. So you must actively read and study the book, which means to have a pencil and paper with you and be willing to follow along and fill in missing details. This type of engagement is not easy and is often frustrating, but if you do so, you will learn a great deal about mathematics and more importantly, about doing mathematics.</p>
