<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In mathematics, as in real life, it is often convenient to think of two different things as being essentially the same. For example, when you go to a store to buy a cold soft drink, the cans of soft drinks in the cooler are often sorted by brand and type of soft drink. The Coca Colas are grouped together, the Pepsi Colas are grouped together, the Dr. Peppers are grouped together, and so on. When we choose a particular can of one type of soft drink, we are assuming that all the cans are essentially the same. Even though the specific cans of one type of soft drink are physically different, it makes no difference which can we choose. In doing this, we are saying that the cans of one type of soft drink are equivalent, and we are using the mathematical notion of an equivalence relation.</p>
