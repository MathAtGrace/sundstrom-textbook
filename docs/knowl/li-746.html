<p>In <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/sec94_comment1.html" title="Item 1">Comment 1</a>, we indicated that \(\mathcal{P} ( \mathbb{N} )\) and \(\mathbb{R}\) have the same cardinality. Combining this with the notation in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/sec94_comment3.html" title="Item 3">Comment 3</a>, this means that</p>

\begin{equation*}
\alpha_1 = \boldsymbol{c}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">However, this does not necessarily mean that \(\boldsymbol{c}\) is the “next largest” cardinal number after \(\aleph_0\text{.}\) A reasonable question is, “Is there an infinite set with cardinality between \(\aleph_0\) and \(\boldsymbol{c}\text{?}\)” Rewording this in terms of the real number line, the question is, “On the real number line, is there an infinite set of points that is not equivalent to the entire line and also not equivalent to the set of natural numbers?” This question was asked by Cantor, but he was unable to find any such set. He conjectured that no such set exists. That is, he conjectured that \(\boldsymbol{c}\) is really the next cardinal number after \(\aleph_0\text{.}\) This conjecture has come to be known as the <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">Continuum Hypothesis</dfn>.  Stated somewhat more formally, the Continuum Hypothesis is <blockquote class="blockquote">There is no set \(X\) such that \(\aleph_0 \lt  \text{ card}  ( X ) 
\lt  \boldsymbol{c}\text{.}\)</blockquote> The question of whether the Continuum Hypothesis is true or false is one of the most famous problems in modern mathematics.</p>
<p>Through the combined work of Kurt Gödel  in the 1930s and Paul Cohen  in 1963, it has been proved that the Continuum Hypothesis cannot be proved or disproved from the standard axioms of set theory. This means that either the Continuum Hypothesis or its negation can be added to the standard axioms of set theory without creating a contradiction.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_uncountablesets.html#li-746">in-context</a></span>
