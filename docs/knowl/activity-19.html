<div class="introduction">
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We have already seen examples of <dfn class="terminology">Pythagorean triples</dfn>,  which are natural numbers \(a\text{,}\) \(b\text{,}\) and \(c\) where \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\text{.}\) For example, 3, 4, and 5 form a Pythagorean triple as do 5, 12, and 13. One of the famous mathematicians of the 17th century was Pierre de Fermat (1601 — 1665).  Fermat made an assertion that for each natural number \(n\) with \(n \geq 3\text{,}\) there are no positive integers \(a\text{,}\) \(b\text{,}\) and \(c\) for which \(a^n + b^n = c^n\text{.}\) This assertion was discovered in a margin of one of Fermat's books after his death, but Fermat provided no proof. He did, however, state that he had discovered a truly remarkable proof but the margin did not contain enough room for the proof.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">This assertion became known as <dfn class="terminology">Fermat's Last Theorem</dfn>  but it more properly should have been called Fermat's Last Conjecture. Despite the efforts of mathematicians, this “theorem” remained unproved until Andrew Wiles, a British mathematician, first announced a proof in June of 1993. However, it was soon recognized that this proof had a serious gap, but a widely accepted version of the proof was published by Wiles in 1995. Wiles' proof uses many concepts and techniques that were unknown at the time of Fermat. We cannot discuss the proof here, but we will explore and prove the following proposition, which is a (very) special case of Fermat's Last Theorem. <article class="proposition theorem-like"><h6 class="heading">

<p>There do not exist prime numbers \(a\text{,}\) \(b\text{,}\) and \(c\) such that  \(a^3 + b^3 = c^3\text{.}\)</p></article> Although Fermat's Last Theorem implies this proposition is true, we will use a proof by contradiction to prove this proposition. For a proof by contradiction, we assume that <blockquote class="blockquote">there exist prime numbers \(a\text{,}\) \(b\text{,}\) and \(c\) such that \(a^3 + b^3 = c^3\text{.}\)</blockquote> Since 2 is the only even prime number, we will use the following cases: (1) \(a = b = 2\text{;}\) (2) \(a\) and \(b\) are both odd; and (3) one of \(a\) and \(b\) is odd and the other one is 2.</p>

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We now know that one of \(a\) or \(b\) must be equal to 2. So we assume that \(b = 2\) and that \(a\) is an odd prime. Substitute \(b = 2\) into the equation \(b^3 = c^3 - a^3\) and then factor the expression \(c^3 - a^3\text{.}\) Use this to obtain a contradiction.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h6 xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h6>
