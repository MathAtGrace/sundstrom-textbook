<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">This type of proof is often used when the conclusion is stated in the form of a negation, but the hypothesis is not. This often works well if the conclusion contains the operator “or”; that is, if the conclusion is in the form of a disjunction. In this case, the negation will be a conjunction.</p>

<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Why the process makes sense.</span></h6>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The statement \(P \to Q\) is either true or false. In a proof by contradiction, we show that it is true by eliminating the only other possibility (that it is false). We show that \(P \to Q\) cannot be false by assuming it is false and reaching a contradiction. Since we assume that \(P \to Q\) is false, and the only way for a conditional statement to be false is for its hypothesis to be true and its conclusion to be false, we assume that \(P\) is true and that \(Q\) is false (or, equivalently, that \(\mynot Q\) is true). When we reach a contradiction, we know that our original assumption that \(P \to Q\) is false is incorrect. Hence, \(P \to Q\) cannot be false, and so it must be true.</p>
