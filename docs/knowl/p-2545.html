<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Historically, it is interesting to note that Indian mathematicians were studying these types of numerical sequences well before Fibonacci. In particular, about fifty years before Fibonacci introduced his sequence, Acharya Hemachandra (sometimes spelled Hemchandra)  (1089 â€” 1173) considered the following problem, which is from the biography of Hemachandra in the <span class="booktitle">MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive</span> at <a class="external" href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hemchandra/" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hemchandra</code></a>. <blockquote class="blockquote">Suppose we assume that lines are composed of syllables which are either short or long. Suppose also that each long syllable takes twice as long to articulate as a short syllable. A line of length \(n\) contains \(n\) units where each short syllable is one unit and each long syllable is two units. Clearly a line of length \(n\) units takes the same time to articulate regardless of how it is composed. Hemchandra asks: How many different combinations of short and long syllables are possible in a line of length \(n\text{?}\)</blockquote></p>
