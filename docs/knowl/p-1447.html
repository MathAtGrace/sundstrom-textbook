<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The proof given for <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/P_linearequation.html" title="Proposition 3.2.6">Proposition 3.2.6</a> is called a <dfn class="terminology">constructive proof.</dfn>  This is a technique that is often used to prove a so-called <dfn class="terminology">existence theorem.</dfn>  The objective of an existence theorem is to prove that a certain mathematical object exists. That is, the goal is usually to prove a statement of the form <blockquote class="blockquote">There exists an \(x\) such that \(P( x )\text{.}\)</blockquote> For a constructive proof of such a proposition, we actually name, describe, or explain how to construct some object in the universe that makes \(P( x )\) true. This is what we did in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/P_linearequation.html" title="Proposition 3.2.6">Proposition 3.2.6</a> since in the proof, we actually proved that \(\dfrac{c - b}{a}\) is a solution of the equation \(ax + b = c\text{.}\) In fact, we proved that this is the only solution of this equation.</p>
