<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In this section, it was noted that there is often more than one way to answer a backward question. For example, if the backward question is, “How can we prove that two real numbers are equal?”, one possible answer is to prove that their difference equals 0. Another possible answer is to prove that the first is less than or equal to the second and that the second is less than or equal to the first. <article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h6>
<p>Give at least one more answer to the backward question, “How can we prove that two real numbers are equal?”</p></article> <article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h6>
<p>List as many answers as you can for the backward question, “How can we prove that a real number is equal to zero?”</p></article> <article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h6>
<p>List as many answers as you can for the backward question, “How can we prove that two lines are parallel?”</p></article> <article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h6>
<p>List as many answers as you can for the backward question, “How can we prove that a triangle is isosceles?”</p></article></p>
