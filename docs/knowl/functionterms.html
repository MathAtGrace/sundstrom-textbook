<section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Some Function Terminology with an Example.</span></h5>. <p>When we have a function \(f \colon A \to B\text{,}\) we often write \(y = f(x)\text{.}\) In this case, we consider \(x\) to be an unspecified object that can be chosen from the set \(A\text{,}\) and we would say that \(x\) is the <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">independent variable</dfn>  of the function \(f\) and \(y\) is the <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">dependent variable</dfn>  of the function \(f\text{.}\)</p>
<p>For a specific example, consider the function \(g \x \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\text{,}\) where \(g( x )\) is defined by the formula</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
g( x ) = x^2  - 2\text{.}\tag{6.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Note that this is indeed a function since given any input \(x\) in the domain, \(\R\text{,}\) there is exactly one output \(g( x )\) in the codomain, \(\R\text{.}\) For example,</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
g( { - 2} ) \amp = \left( { - 2} \right)^2  - 2 = 2,\\
g( 5 ) \amp = 5^2  - 2 = 23,\\
g( {\sqrt 2 } ) \amp = \left( {\sqrt 2 } \right)^2  - 2 = 0,\\
g( { - \sqrt 2 } ) \amp = \left( { - \sqrt 2 } \right)^2  - 2 = 0\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">So we say that the image of \(-2\) under \(g\) is 2, the image of 5 under \(g\) is 23, and so on.</p>
<p>Notice in this case that the number 0 in the codomain has two preimages, \(- \sqrt 2 \text{ and } \sqrt 2\text{.}\) This does not violate the mathematical definition of a function since the definition only states that each input must produce one and only one output. That is, each element of the domain has exactly one image in the codomain. Nowhere does the definition stipulate that two different inputs must produce different outputs.</p>
<p>Finding the preimages of an element in the codomain can sometimes be difficult. In general, if \(y\) is in the codomain, to find its preimages, we need to ask, “For which values of \(x\) in the domain will we have \(y = g( x )\text{?}\)” For example, for the function \(g\text{,}\) to find the preimages of 5, we need to find all \(x\) for which \(g( x ) = 5\text{.}\) In this case, since \(g( x ) = x^2  - 2\text{,}\) we can do this by solving the equation</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
x^2  - 2 = 5\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">The solutions of this equation are \(- \sqrt 7\) and \(\sqrt 7\text{.}\) So for the function \(g\text{,}\) the preimages of 5 are \(- \sqrt 7\) and \(\sqrt 7\text{.}\) We often use set notation for this and say that the set of preimages of 5 for the function \(g\) is \(\left\{ -\sqrt{7}, \sqrt{7} \right\}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Also notice that for this function, not every element in the codomain has a preimage. For example, there is no input \(x\) such that \(g\left( x \right) = - 3\text{.}\) This is true since for all real numbers \(x\text{,}\) \(x^2 \geq 0\) and hence \(x^2 - 2 \geq - 2\text{.}\) This means that for all \(x\) in \(\mathbb{R}\text{,}\) \(g\left( x \right) \geq - 2\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Finally, note that we introduced the function \(g\) with the sentence, “Consider the function \(g\x \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\text{,}\) where \(g( x )\) is defined by the formula \(g( x ) = x^2 - 2\text{.}\)” This is one correct way to do this, but we will frequently shorten this to, “Let \(g\x \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) be defined by \(g( x ) = x^2 - 2\)”, or “Let \(g\x \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\text{,}\) where \(g( x ) = x^2 - 2\text{.}\)”</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="S_introfunctions.html#functionterms">in-context</a></span>
