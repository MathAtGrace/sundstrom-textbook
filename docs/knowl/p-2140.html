<p>We have already seen examples of <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">Pythagorean triples</dfn>,  which are natural numbers \(a\text{,}\) \(b\text{,}\) and \(c\) where \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\text{.}\) For example, 3, 4, and 5 form a Pythagorean triple as do 5, 12, and 13. One of the famous mathematicians of the 17th century was Pierre de Fermat (1601 â€” 1665).  Fermat made an assertion that for each natural number \(n\) with \(n \geq 3\text{,}\) there are no positive integers \(a\text{,}\) \(b\text{,}\) and \(c\) for which \(a^n + b^n = c^n\text{.}\) This assertion was discovered in a margin of one of Fermat's books after his death, but Fermat provided no proof. He did, however, state that he had discovered a truly remarkable proof but the margin did not contain enough room for the proof.</p>
