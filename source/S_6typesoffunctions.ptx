  <title>Injections, Surjections, and Bijections</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Functions are frequently used in mathematics to define and describe certain relationships 
      between sets and other mathematical objects.
      In addition,
      functions can be used to impose certain mathematical structures on sets.
      In this section,
      we will study special types of functions that are used to describe these relationships 
      that are called injections and surjections.
      Before defining these types of functions,
      we will revisit what the definition of a function tells us and explore certain functions 
      with finite domains.

      <title>Beginning Activity 1: Functions with Finite Domains</title>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be sets.
        Given a function <m>f\x A \to B</m>, we know the following:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              For every <m>x \in A</m>, <m>f( x ) \in B</m>.
              That is, every element of <m>A</m> is an input for the function <m>f</m>.
              This could also be stated as follows: For each <m>x \in A</m>,
              there exists a <m>y \in B</m> such that <m>y = f( x )</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For a given <m>x \in A</m>,
              there is exactly one <m>y \in B</m> such that <m>y = f( x )</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The definition of a function does not require that different inputs produce different outputs.
        That is, it is possible to have <m>x_1 , x_2 \in A</m> with
        <m>x_1 \ne x_2</m> and <m>f( {x_1 } ) = f( {x_2 } )</m>.
        The arrow diagram for the function <m>f</m> in <xref ref="fig_arrow63-1new"></xref> 
        illustrates such a function.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, the definition of a function does not require that the range of the function must 
        equal the codomain.
        The range is always a subset of the codomain,
        but these two sets are not required to be equal.
        That is, if <m>g\x A \to B</m>,
        then it is possible to have a <m>y \in B</m> such that
        <m>g( x ) \ne y</m> for all <m>x \in A</m>.
        The arrow diagram for the function <m>g</m> in <xref ref="fig_arrow63-1new"></xref> 
        illustrates such a function.

        Now let <m>A = \left\{ {1,2,3} \right\}</m>,

  <subsection>
    <title>Injections</title>
    <p>
      In previous sections and in <xref text="custom" ref="PA_functionswithfinitedom">Beginning Activity 1</xref>,
      we have seen examples of functions for which there exist different inputs that produce 
      the same output.
      Using more formal notation,
      this means that there are functions
      <m>f:A \to B</m> for which there exist \mbox{<m>x_1 , x_2 \in A</m>} with
      <m>x_1 \ne x_2</m> and <m>f( {x_1 } ) = f( {x_2 } )</m>.
      The work in the beginning activities was intended to motivate the following definition.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="injection">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f:A \to B</m> be a function from the set <m>A</m> to the set <m>B</m>.
          The function <m>f</m> is called an <term>injection</term>
              <idx><h>injection</h></idx>
          provided that 
          <blockquote>
            for all <m>x_1 , x_2 \in A</m>,
            if <m>x_1 \ne x_2</m>, then <m>f( {x_1 } ) \ne f( {x_2 } )</m>.
          </blockquote>
          When <m>f</m> is an injection,
          we also say that <m>f</m> is a <term>one-to-one function</term>,
              <idx><h>one-to-one function</h></idx>
              <idx><h>function</h><h>one-to-one</h></idx>
          or that <m>f</m> is an <term>injective function</term>.
              <idx><h>function</h><h>injective</h></idx>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Notice that the condition that specifies that a function <m>f</m> is an injection is given 
      in the form of a conditional statement.
      As we shall see, in proofs,
      it is usually easier to use the contrapositive of this conditional statement.
      Although we did not define the term then,
      we have already written the contrapositive for the conditional statement in the definition 
      of an injection in <xref ref="PA_functionstatements1"></xref> of 
      <xref text="custom" ref="PA_functionstatements">Beginning Activity 2</xref>.
      In that activity,
      we also wrote the negation of the definition of an injection.
      Following is a summary of this work giving the conditions for <m>f</m> being an injection 
      or not being an injection.

      One of the conditions that specifies that a function <m>f</m> is a surjection is given 
      in the form of a universally quantified statement,
      which is the primary statement used in proving a function is
      (or is not)
      a surjection.
      Although we did not define the term then,
      we have already written the negation for the statement defining a surjection in 
      <xref ref="PA_functionstatements2"></xref> of 
      <xref text="custom" ref="PA_functionstatements">Beginning Activity 2</xref>.
      We now summarize the conditions for <m>f</m> being a surjection or not being a surjection.

    <title>The Importance of the Domain and Codomain</title>
    <p>
      The functions in the next two examples will illustrate why the domain and the codomain 
      of a function are just as important as the rule defining the outputs of a function when we 
      need to determine if the function is a surjection.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="E_domainandcodomain">
      <title>A Function that Is Neither an Injection nor a Surjection</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f\x \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}</m> be defined by <m>f( x ) = x^2  + 1</m>.
          Notice that
          <me>
            f( 2 ) = 5  \text{ and }  f( { - 2} ) = 5
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is enough to prove that the function <m>f</m> is not an injection since this 
          shows that there exist two different inputs that produce the same output.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>f( x ) = x^2 + 1</m>,
          we know that <m>f( x ) \geq 1</m> for all <m>x \in \mathbb{R}</m>.
          This implies that the function <m>f</m> is not a surjection.
          For example, <m>- 2</m> is in the codomain of <m>f</m> and
          <m>f( x ) \ne - 2</m> for all <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="E_domainandcodomain2">
      <title>A Function that Is Not an Injection but Is a Surjection</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>T = \left\{ y \in \mathbb{R} \mid y \geq 1 \right\}</m>,
          and define <m>F\x \mathbb{R} \to T</m> by <m>F( x ) = x^2 + 1</m>.
          As in <xref ref="E_domainandcodomain"></xref>,
          the function <m>F</m> is not an injection since <m>F( 2 ) = F( { - 2} ) = 5</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is the function <m>F</m> a surjection?
          That is, does <m>F</m> map <m>\mathbb{R}</m> onto <m>T</m>?
          As in <xref ref="E_domainandcodomain"></xref>,
          we do know that <m>F( x ) \geq 1</m> for all <m>x \in \mathbb{R}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To see if it is a surjection,
          we must determine if it is true that for every <m>y \in T</m>,
          there exists an <m>x \in \mathbb{R}</m> such that <m>F ( x ) = y</m>.
          So we choose <m>y \in T</m>.
          The goal is to determine if there exists an <m>x \in \mathbb{R}</m> such that
          <md>
            <mrow>F( x ) \amp = y \text{ , or }</mrow>
            <mrow>x^2  + 1 \amp = y</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          One way to proceed is to work backward and solve the last equation
          (if possible)
          for <m>x</m>.
          Doing so, we get
          <md>
            <mrow>x^2 \amp = y - 1</mrow>
            <mrow>x = \sqrt {y - 1} \amp \text{   or   } x =  - \sqrt {y - 1}</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, since <m>y \in T</m>,
          we know that <m>y \geq 1</m> and hence that <m>y - 1 \geq 0</m>.
          This means that <m>\sqrt {y - 1}  \in \mathbb{R}</m>.
          Hence, if we use <m>x = \sqrt {y - 1}</m>,
          then <m>x \in \mathbb{R}</m>, and
          <md>
            <mrow>F( x ) \amp = F\left( {\sqrt {y - 1} } \:\right)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \left( {\sqrt {y - 1} } \: \right)^2  + 1</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = ( {y - 1} ) + 1</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = y</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This proves that <m>F</m> is a surjection since we have shown that for all <m>y \in T</m>,
          there exists an <m>x \in \mathbb{R}</m> such that <m>F( x ) = y</m>.
          Notice that for each <m>y \in T</m>,
          this was a constructive proof of the existence of an
          <m>x \in \mathbb{R}</m> such that <m>F ( x ) = y</m>.

    <title>An Important Lesson</title>
    <p>
      
      In <xref ref="E_domainandcodomain"></xref>
      and <xref ref="E_domainandcodomain2"></xref>,
      the same mathematical formula was used to determine the outputs for the functions.
      However, one function was not a surjection and the other one was a surjection.
      This illustrates the important fact that whether a function is surjective depends not 
      only on the formula that defines the output of the function but also on the domain and 
      codomain of the function.
    </p>
    </paragraphs>
    <p>
      The next example will show that whether or not a function is an injection also depends 
      on the domain of the function.

        <p>
          Notice that the codomain is <m>\mathbb{N}</m>,
          and the table of values suggests that some natural numbers are not outputs of this function.
          So it appears that the function <m>g</m> is not a surjection.
        </p>
        <p>
          To prove that <m>g</m> is not a surjection,
          pick an element of <m>\N</m> that does not appear to be in the range.
          We will use 3, and we will use a proof by contradiction to prove that there is no 
          <m>x</m> in the domain
          <m>\left( \Z^*\right)</m> such that <m>g( x ) = 3</m>.
          So we assume that there exists an
          <m>x \in \Z^*</m> with <m>g( x ) = 3</m>.
          Then
          <md>
            <mrow>x^2  + 1 \amp = 3</mrow>
            <mrow>x^2 \amp = 2</mrow>
            <mrow>x \amp =  \pm \sqrt 2</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this is not possible since <m>\sqrt 2 \notin \mathbb{Z}^*</m>.
          Therefore, there is no <m>x \in \mathbb{Z}^*</m> with <m>g( x ) = 3</m>.
          This means that for every <m>x \in \mathbb{Z}^*</m>, <m>g( x ) \ne 3</m>.
          Therefore, 3 is not in the range of <m>g</m>,
          and hence <m>g</m> is not a surjection.
        </p>
        <p>
          The table of values suggests that different inputs produce different outputs,
          and hence that <m>g</m> is an injection.
          To prove that <m>g</m> is an injection,
          assume that <m>s, t \in \Z^*</m>
          (the domain)
          with <m>g( s ) = g( t )</m>.
          Then
          <md>
            <mrow>s^2  + 1 \amp = t^2  + 1</mrow>
            <mrow>s^2  \amp = t^2</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>s, t \in \mathbb{Z}^*</m>,
          we know that <m>s \geq 0\text{ and } t \geq 0</m>.
          So the preceding equation implies that <m>s = t</m>.
          Hence, <m>g</m> is an injection.

      <p>
        The function <m>g</m> is an injection and is a surjection.
        The proof that <m>g</m> is an injection is basically the same as the proof that 
        <m>f</m> is an injection.
        To prove that <m>g</m> is a surjection, let <m>b \in \R^+</m>.
        To construct the real number <m>a</m> such that <m>g(a) = b</m>,
        solve the equation <m>e^{-a} = b</m> for <m>a</m>.
        The solution is <m>a = -\ln b</m>.
        It can then be verified that <m>g(a) = b</m>.

    <title>Working with a Function of Two Variables</title>
    
    <p>
      It takes time and practice to become efficient at working with the formal definitions of 
      injection and surjection.
      As we have seen, all parts of a function are important
      (the domain,
      the codomain, and the rule for determining outputs).
      This is especially true for functions of two variables.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example,
      we define <m>f\x \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</m> by
      <me>
        f( {a, b} ) = ( {2a + b, a - b} )  \text{ for all } ( {a, b} ) \in \R \times \R
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that both the domain and the codomain of this function are the set 
      <m>\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</m>.
      Thus, the inputs and the outputs of this function are ordered pairs of real numbers.
      For example,
      <me>
        f( {1, 1} ) = ( {3, 0} )  \text{ and }   f( { - 1, 2} ) = ( {0,  - 3} ). \\
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      To explore whether or not <m>f</m> is an injection,
      we assume that <m>( {a, b} ) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</m>,
      <m>( {c, d} ) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</m>,
      and <m>f( {a, b} ) = f( {c, d} )</m>.
      This means that
      <me>
        ( {2a + b, a - b} ) = ( {2c + d, c - d} )
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since this equation is an equality of ordered pairs, we see that
      <md>
        <mrow>2a + b \amp = 2c + d\text{, and }</mrow>
        <mrow>a - b \amp = c - d\!</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By adding the corresponding sides of the two equations in this system,
      we obtain <m>3a = 3c</m> and hence, <m>a = c</m>.
      Substituting <m>a = c</m> into either equation in the system give us <m>b = d</m>.
      Since <m>a = c</m> and <m>b = d</m>, we conclude that
      <me>
        ( {a, b} ) = ( {c, d} )
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence, we have shown that if <m>f( {a, b} ) = f( {c, d} )</m>,
      then <m>( {a, b} ) = ( {c, d} )</m>.
      Therefore, <m>f</m> is an injection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, to determine if <m>f</m> is a surjection,
      we let <m>( {r, s} ) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</m>,
      where <m>( {r, s} )</m> is considered to be an arbitrary element of the codomain of the 
      function <m>f</m>.
      Can we find an ordered pair
      <m>( {a, b} ) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</m> such that <m>f( {a, b} ) = ( {r, s} )</m>?
      Working backward, we see that in order to do this, we need
      <me>
        ( {2a + b, a - b} ) = ( {r, s} )
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is, we need
      <me>
        2a + b = r  \text{ and }      a - b = s
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solving this system for <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> yields
      <me>
        a = \frac{{r + s}}{3} \text{ and }  b = \frac{{r - 2s}}{3}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>r, s \in \mathbb{R}</m>,
      we can conclude that <m>a \in \mathbb{R}</m> and
      <m>b \in \mathbb{R}</m> and hence that <m>( {a, b} ) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</m>. 
      We now need to verify that for these values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
      we get <m>f( {a, b} ) = ( {r, s} )</m>.
      So
      <md>
        <mrow>f( {a, b} ) \amp = f\!\left( {\frac{{r + s}}{3}, \frac{{r - 2s}}{3}} \right)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \left( {2\left( {\frac{{r + s}}{3}} \right) + \frac{{r - 2s}}{3}, 
        \frac{{r + s}}{3} - \frac{{r - 2s}}{3}} \right)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \left( {\frac{{2r + 2s + r - 2s}}{3}, \frac{{r + s - r + 2s}}{3}} \right)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = ( {r, s} )</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      This proves that for all <m>( {r, s} ) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</m>,
      there exists <m>( {a, b} ) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</m> such that 
      <m>f( {a, b} ) = ( {r, s} )</m>.
      Hence, the function <m>f</m> is a surjection.
      Since <m>f</m> is both an injection and a surjection, it is a bijection.

        <answer>
          <p>
            The function <m>f</m> is an injection.  To prove this, let 
            <m>x_1, x_2 \in \mathbb{Z}</m> and assume that <m>f ( x_1 ) = f ( x_2 )</m>.  Then,

        <answer>
          <p>
            Since <m>h(1) = h(4)</m>, the function <m>h</m> is not an injection.  Using calculus, 
            we can see that the function <m>h</m> has a maximum when <m>x = 2</m> and a minimum 
            when <m>x = -2</m>, and so for each <m>x \in \R</m>, <m>h(-2) \leq h(x) \leq h(2)</m> or
            <me>
              -\frac{1}{2} \leq h(x) \leq \frac{1}{2}
            </me>.
            This can be used to prove that <m>h</m> is not a surjection.
            We can also prove that there is no <m>x \in \R</m> such that <m>h(x) = 1</m> using a 
            proof by contradiction. If such an <m>x</m> were to exist, then 
            <m>\dfrac{2x}{x^2 + 4} = 1</m> or <m>2x = x^2 + 4</m>.  Hence, <m>x^2 - 2x + 4 = 0</m>.  
            We can then use the quadratic formula to prove that <m>x</m> is not a real number. 
            Hence, there is no real number <m>x</m> such that <m>h(x) = 1</m> and so <m>h</m> is 
            not a surjection.

            <m>x \in \mathbb{R}</m>. Let <m>x_1, x_2 \in \mathbb{R}</m> and assume that

          Let <m>f\x\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</m> 
          be defined by <m>f( {x, y} ) = ( {2x, x + y} )</m>.
          Is the function <m>f</m> an injection?
          Is the function <m>f</m> a surjection?
        </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
          <p>
            The function <m>f</m> is an injection and a surjection. To prove that <m>f</m> is an 
            injection, we assume that
            <m>( {a, b} ) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</m>,
            <m>( {c, d} ) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</m>, and that
            <m>f( {a, b} ) = f( {c, d} )</m>. This means that
            <me>
            ( {2a, a + b} ) = ( {2c, c + d} )
            </me>.
            Since this equation is an equality of ordered pairs, we see that
            <md>
              <mrow>2a \amp = 2c \text{ , and }</mrow>
              <mrow>a + b \amp = c + d</mrow>
            </md>
            The first equation implies that <m>a = c</m>. Substituting this into the second 
            equation shows that
            <m>b = d</m>. Hence,
            <me>
            ( {a, b} ) = ( {c, d} )
            </me>,
            and we have shown that if <m>f( {a, b} ) = f( {c, d} )</m>, then
            <m>( {a, b} ) = ( {c, d} )</m>. Therefore, <m>f</m> is an injection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, to determine if <m>f</m> is a surjection, we let
            <m>( {r, s} ) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</m>. To find an ordered pair
            <m>( {a, b} ) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</m> such that
            <m>f( {a, b} ) = ( {r, s} )</m>, we need
            <me>
            ( {2a, a + b} ) = ( {r, s} )
            </me>.
            That is, we need
            <md>
              <mrow>2a \amp = r\text{ , and }</mrow>
              <mrow>a + b \amp = s</mrow>
            </md>.
            Solving this system for <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> yields
            <me>
            a = \frac{{r}}{2} \text{ and } b = \frac{{2s - r}}{2}
            </me>.
            Since <m>r, s \in \mathbb{R}</m>, we can conclude that <m>a \in \mathbb{R}</m> and
            <m>b \in \mathbb{R}</m> and hence that
            <m>( {a, b} ) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</m> . So,
            <md>
              <mrow>f( {a, b} ) \amp = f\left( {\frac{{r}}{2}, \frac{{2s - r}}{2}} \right)</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \left( {2\left( {\frac{{r}}{2}} \right),\frac{{r}}{2} + 
              \frac{{2s - r}}{2}} \right)</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = ( {r, s} )</mrow>
            </md>

            This proves that for all <m>( {r, s} ) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</m>, 
            there exists <m>( {a, b} ) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</m> such that
            <m>f( {a, b} ) = ( {r, s} )</m>. Hence, the function <m>f</m> is a surjection. 
            Since <m>f</m> is both an injection and a surjection, it is a bijection.

          In exploring whether or not the function is an injection,
          it might be a good idea to use cases based on whether the inputs are even or odd.
          In exploring whether <m>f</m> is a surjection,
          consider using cases based on whether the output is positive or less than or equal to zero.

                  (2c + b, c - b) = (2c + d, c - d)
                </me>.
              </p>
              <p>
                So <m>b = d</m>.
                Therefore, we have proved that the function <m>f</m> is an injection.

              <p>
                The function <m>f\x\R \times \R \to \R \times \R</m> defined by 
                <m>f( {x, y} ) = ( {2x + y, x - y} )</m> is a surjection.

            <li>
              <title>Proof</title>
              <p>
                We need to find an ordered pair such that
                <m>f(x, y) = (a, b)</m> for each <m>(a, b)</m> in <m>\R \times \R</m>.
                That is, we need <m>(2x + y, x - y) = (a, b)</m>, or
                <me>
                  2x + y = a \qquad \text{ and }  \qquad x - y = b
                </me>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Treating these two equations as a system of equations and solving for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>,
                we find that
                <me>
                  x = \frac{a + b}{3} \qquad \text{ and }  \qquad y = \frac{a - 2b}{3}
                </me>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hence, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are real numbers,
                <m>(x, y) \in \R \times \R</m>, and
                <md>
                  <mrow>f(x, y) \amp = f \left( \frac{a + b}{3}, \frac{a - 2b}{3} \right)</mrow>
                  <mrow>\amp = \left(2 \left( \frac{a + b}{3} \right) + \frac{a - 2b}{3}, 
                  \frac{a + b}{3} - \frac{a - 2b}{3} \right)</mrow>
                  <mrow>\amp = \left( \frac{2a + 2b + a - 2b}{3}, \frac{a + b - a + 2b}{3} \right)</mrow>
                  <mrow>\amp = \left( \frac{3a}{3}, \frac{3b}{3} \right)</mrow>
                  <mrow>\amp = (a, b)</mrow>
                </md>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Therefore, we have proved that for every <m>(a, b) \in \R \times \R</m>,
                there exists an <m>(x, y) \in \R \times \R</m> such that <m>f(x, y) = (a, b)</m>.
                This proves that the function <m>f</m> is a surjection.

          For example, we can define a function
          <m>f\x\R \to \R</m> by giving a rule for calculating <m>f(x)</m> when
          <m>x \geq 0</m> and giving a rule for calculating <m>f(x)</m> when <m>x \lt  0</m> as follows:
          <men>
            f(x) = \begin{cases}x^2 + 1,    \amp   \text{ if \(x \geq 0\); }  \\ x - 1      \amp   \text{ if \(x \lt  0\). } \end{cases}
