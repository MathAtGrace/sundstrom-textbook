    <title>Equivalent Sets</title>
    <p>
      In <xref text="custom" ref="PA_equivalentsets">Beginning Activity 1</xref>,
      we introduced the concept of equivalent sets.
      The motivation for this definition was to have a formal method for determining whether or 
      not two sets
      <q>have the same number of elements.</q>
      This idea was described in terms of a one-to-one correspondence (a bijection) from one set 
      onto the other set.
      This idea may seem simple for finite sets, but as we will see,
      this idea has surprising consequences when we deal with infinite sets.
      (We will soon provide precise definitions for finite and infinite sets.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Technical Note: The three properties we proved in <xref ref="T_equivsets"></xref>
      in <xref text="custom" ref="PA_equivsets2">Beginning Activity 2</xref>
      are very similar to the concepts of reflexive,
      symmetric, and transitive relations.
      However, we do not consider equivalence of sets to be an equivalence relation on a set 
      <m>U</m> since an equivalence relation requires an underlying (universal) set <m>U</m>.
      In this case,
      our elements would be the sets <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>,
      and these would then have to be subsets of some universal set <m>W</m>
      (elements of the power set of <m>W</m>).
      For equivalence of sets, we are not requiring that the sets <m>A</m>,
      <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> be subsets of the same universal set.
      So we do not use the term relation in regards to the equivalence of sets.
      However, if <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are sets and <m>A \approx B</m>,
      then we often say that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are
      <term>equivalent sets</term>.
    </p>

    <exercise xml:id="prog_equivsets">
      <title>Examples of Equivalent Sets</title>
      <introduction>
      <p>
        We will use the definition of equivalent sets from 
        <xref text="custom" ref="PA_equivalentsets">Beginning Activity 1</xref>
        in all parts of this progress check.
        It is no longer sufficient to say that two sets are equivalent by simply saying 
        that the two sets have the same number of elements.
      </p>
      </introduction>

          <task>
            <statement>
            <p>
              Let <m>A = \left\{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 99, 100 \right\}</m> and let 
              <m>B = \left\{ 351, 352, 353, \ldots, 449, 450 \right\}</m>.
              Define <m>f\x A \to B</m> by <m>f(x) = x + 350</m>,
              for each <m>x</m> in <m>A</m>.
              Prove that <m>f</m> is a bijection from the set <m>A</m> to the set 
              <m>B</m> and hence,
              <m>A \approx B</m>.
            </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
                We first prove that <m>f\x A \to B</m> is an injection.
                So let <m>x, y \in A</m> and assume that <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>.
                Then <m>x + 350 = y + 350</m> and we can conclude that <m>x = y</m>.
                Hence, <m>f</m> is an injection.
                To prove that <m>f</m> is a surjection, let <m>b \in B</m>.
                Then <m>351 \leq b \leq 450</m> and hence,
                <m>1 \leq b - 350 \leq 100</m> and so <m>b - 350 \in A</m>.
                In addition, <m>f(b - 350) = (b - 350) + 350 = b</m>.
                This proves that <m>f</m> is a surjection.
                Hence, the function <m>f</m> is a bijection,
                and so, <m>A \approx B</m>.

              Let <m>E</m> be the set of all even integers and let <m>D</m> be the set of all 
              odd integers.
              Prove that <m>E \approx D</m> by proving that <m>F\x E \to D</m>,
              where <m>F \left( x \right) = x + 1</m>,
              for all <m>x \in E</m>, is a bijection.
            </p>

            <solution>
              <p>
                If <m>x</m> and <m>t</m> are even integers and <m>F ( x ) = F ( t )</m>,
                then <m>x + 1 = t + 1</m> and, hence, <m>x = t</m>.
                Therefore, <m>F</m> is an injection.
                To prove that <m>F</m> is a surjection, let <m>y \in D</m>.
                This means that <m>y</m> is an odd integer and, hence,
                <m>y - 1</m> is an even integer.
                In addition,
                <me>
                  F ( y - 1 ) = ( y - 1 ) + 1 = y
                </me>.
                Therefore, <m>F</m> is a surjection and hence, <m>F</m> is a bijection.
                We conclude that <m>E \approx D</m>.

              let <m>\left( 0, b \right)</m> be the open interval of real numbers between 0 and <m>b</m>.

                Therefore, <m>f</m> is an injection.
                To prove that <m>f</m> is a surjection,
                let <m>y \in ( 0, b )</m>.
                Since <m>0 \lt  y \lt  b</m>,
                we conclude that <m>0 \lt  \dfrac{y}{b} \lt  1</m> and that

                </me>.
                Therefore, <m>f</m> is a surjection and hence <m>f</m> is a bijection.

    <p>
      In <xref ref="A_equivsets4"/> of <xref ref="prog_equivsets"></xref>,
      notice that if <m>b > 1</m>,
      then <m>\left( 0, 1 \right)</m> is a proper subset of
      <m>\left( 0, b \right)</m> and <m>\left( 0, 1 \right) \approx \left( 0, b \right)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, in <xref text="custom" ref="PA_equivalentsets5"/> of <xref text="custom" ref="PA_equivalentsets">Beginning Activity 1</xref>,
      we proved that the set <m>D</m> of all odd natural numbers is equivalent to <m>\mathbb{N}</m>,
      and we know that <m>D</m> is a proper subset of <m>\mathbb{N}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      These results may seem a bit strange,
      but they are logical consequences of the definition of equivalent sets.
      Although we have not defined the terms yet,
      we will see that one thing that will distinguish an infinite set from a finite set is 
      that an infinite set can be equivalent to one of its proper subsets,
      whereas a finite set cannot be equivalent to one of its proper subsets.

          <term>cardinality 0</term>
          (or <term>cardinal number 0</term>),
          and we write <m>\text{ card} \left( \emptyset \right) = 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Notice that by this definition,
      the empty set is a finite set.
      In addition, for each <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>,
      the identity function on <m>\mathbb{N}_k</m> is a bijection and hence,
      by definition,
      the set <m>\mathbb{N}_k</m> is a finite set with cardinality <m>k</m>.

    <theorem xml:id="T_equivfinitesets">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Any set equivalent to a finite nonempty set <m>A</m> is a finite set and has the 
          same cardinality as <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>A</m> is a finite nonempty set,
        <m>B</m> is a set, and <m>A \approx B</m>.
        Since <m>A</m> is a finite set,
        there exists a <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m> such that <m>A \approx \mathbb{N}_k</m>.
        We also have assumed that <m>A \approx B</m> and so by <xref ref="T_equivsets2"/> of 
        <xref ref="T_equivsets"></xref>
        (in <xref text="custom" ref="PA_equivsets2">Beginning Activity 2</xref>),
        we can conclude that <m>B \approx A</m>.
        Since <m>A \approx \mathbb{N}_k</m>,
        we can use <xref ref="T_equivsets3"/> of <xref ref="T_equivsets"></xref>
        to conclude that <m>B \approx \mathbb{N}_k</m>.
        Thus, <m>B</m> is finite and has the same cardinality as <m>A</m>.

    <p>
      It may seem that we have done a lot of work to prove an
      <q>obvious</q>
      result in <xref ref="T_equivfinitesets"></xref>.
      The same may be true of the remaining results in this section,
      which give further results about finite sets.
      One of the goals is to make sure that the concept of cardinality for a finite set 
      corresponds to our intuitive notion of the number of elements in the set.
      Another important goal is to lay the groundwork for a more rigorous and mathematical 
      treatment of infinite sets than we have encountered before.
      Along the way,
      we will see the mathematical distinction between finite and infinite sets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following two lemmas will be used to prove the theorem that states that every subset 
      of a finite set is finite.
    </p>

    <lemma xml:id="L_addone">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>A</m> is a finite set and <m>x \notin A</m>,
          then <m>A \cup \left\{ x \right\}</m> is a finite set and 
          <m>\text{ card} \!\left( A \cup \left\{ x \right\} \right) = \text{ card} ( A ) + 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a finite set and assume <m>\text{ card} ( A ) = k</m>,
        where <m>k = 0</m> or <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>.
        Assume <m>x \notin A</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>A = \emptyset</m>,
        then <m>\text{ card} ( A ) = 0</m> and <m>A \cup \left\{ x \right\} = \left\{ x \right\}</m>,
        which is equivalent to <m>\mathbb{N}_1</m>.
        Thus, <m>A \cup \left\{ x \right\}</m> is finite with cardinality 1, which equals 
        <m>\text{ card} ( A ) + 1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>A \ne \emptyset</m>,
        then <m>A \approx \mathbb{N}_k</m>,
        for some <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>.
        This means that <m>\text{ card} ( A ) = k</m>,
        and there exists a bijection <m>f\x A \to \mathbb{N}_k</m>.
        We will now use this bijection to define a function
        <m>g\x A \cup \left\{ x \right\} \to \mathbb{N}_{k+1}</m> and then prove that the 
        function <m>g</m> is a bijection.
        We define <m>g\x A \cup \left\{ x \right\} \to \mathbb{N}_{k+1}</m> as follows: 
        For each <m>t \in A \cup \left\{ x \right\}</m>,
        <me>
          g \left( t \right) = \left\{ \begin{gathered} f \left( t \right) \text{  if  } t 
          \in A  \\ k + 1 \text{  if  } t = x. \end{gathered}  \right.
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        To prove that <m>g</m> is an injection,
        we let <m>x_1, x_2 \in A \cup \left\{ x \right\}</m> and assume <m>x_1 \ne x_2</m>.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>x_1, x_2 \in A</m>,
              then since <m>f</m> is a bijection,
              <m>f( x_1 ) \ne f ( x_2 )</m>,
              and this implies that <m>g( x_1 ) \ne g( x_2 )</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>x_1 = x</m>, then since <m>x_2 \ne x_1</m>,
              we conclude that <m>x_2 \ne x</m> and hence <m>x_2 \in A</m>.
              So <m>g( x_1 ) = k + 1</m>,
              and since <m>f( x_2 ) \in \mathbb{N}_k</m> and <m>g( x_2 ) = f ( x_2 )</m>,
              we can conclude that <m>g( x_1 ) \ne g( x_2 )</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The case where <m>x_2 = x</m> is handled similarly to the previous case.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        This proves that the function <m>g</m> is an injection.
        The proof that <m>g</m> is a surjection is <xref ref="exer_addonesurjection"/>.
        Since <m>g</m> is a bijection,
        we conclude that <m>A \cup \left\{ x \right\} \approx \mathbb{N}_{k+1}</m>, and
        <me>
          \text{ card}  \!\left(A \cup \left\{ x \right\} \right) = k + 1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>\text{ card} \left(A \right) = k</m>,
        we have proved that <m>\text{ card} \!\left(A \cup \left\{ x \right\} \right) = 
        \text{ card} ( A ) + 1</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    </lemma>
    
    <lemma xml:id="L_subsetsofNk">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For each natural number <m>m</m>,
          if <m>A \subseteq \mathbb{N}_m</m>,
          then <m>A</m> is a finite set and <m>\text{ card} \left( A \right) \leq m</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    
    <proof>
      <p>
        We will use a proof using induction on <m>m</m>.
        For each <m>m \in \mathbb{N}</m>, let <m>P( m )</m> be,
        <q>If <m>A \subseteq \mathbb{N}_m</m>,
        then <m>A</m> is finite and <m>\text{ card} ( A ) \leq m</m>.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
        We first prove that <m>P( 1 )</m> is true.
        If <m>A \subseteq \mathbb{N}_1</m>,
        then <m>A = \emptyset</m> or <m>A = \left\{ 1 \right\}</m>,
        both of which are finite and have cardinality less than or equal to the cardinality of 
        <m>\mathbb{N}_1</m>.
        This proves that <m>P( 1 )</m> is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the inductive step, let
        <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m> and assume that <m>P( k )</m> is true.
        That is, assume that if <m>B \subseteq \mathbb{N}_k</m>,
        then <m>B</m> is a finite set and <m>\text{ card} ( B ) \leq k</m>.
        We need to prove that <m>P( k+1 )</m> is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        So assume that <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>\mathbb{N}_{k+1}</m>.
        Then <m>A - \left\{ k+1 \right\}</m> is a subset of <m>\mathbb{N}_k</m>.
        Since <m>P( k )</m> is true,
        <m>A - \left\{ k+1 \right\}</m> is a finite set and
        <me>
          \text{ card}  \!\left( A - \left\{ k+1 \right\} \right) \leq k
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two cases to consider: Either
        <m>k+1 \in A</m> or <m>k+1 \not \in A</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>k+1 \not \in A</m>, then <m>A = A - \left\{ k+1 \right\}</m>.
        Hence, <m>A</m> is finite and
        <me>
          \text{ card}  ( A ) \leq k \lt  k+1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>k+1 \in A</m>,
        then <m>A = ( A - \left\{ k+1 \right\} ) \cup \left\{ k+1 \right\}</m>.
        Hence, by <xref ref="L_addone"></xref>,
        <m>A</m> is a finite set and
        <me>
          \text{ card}  ( A ) = \text{ card}  \!\left(  A - \left\{ k+1 \right\}  \right) + 1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>\text{ card} \!\left( A - \left\{ k+1 \right\} \right) \leq k</m>,
        we can conclude that <m>\text{ card} ( A ) \leq k + 1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that we have proved the inductive step.
        Hence, by mathematical induction,
        for each <m>m \in \mathbb{N}</m>,
        if <m>A \subseteq \mathbb{N}_m</m>,
        then <m>A</m> is finite and <m>\text{ card} ( A ) \leq m</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    </lemma>

    <p>
      The preceding two lemmas were proved to aid in the proof of the following theorem.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="T_finitesubsets">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>S</m> is a finite set and <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>S</m>,
          then <m>A</m> is a finite set and <m>\text{ card} ( A ) \leq \text{ card} ( S )</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>S</m> be a finite set and assume that <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>S</m>.
        If <m>A = \emptyset</m>,
        then <m>A</m> is a finite set and <m>\text{ card} ( A ) \leq \text{ card} ( S )</m>.
        So we assume that <m>A \ne \emptyset</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>S</m> is finite,
        there exists a bijection <m>f\x S \to \mathbb{N}_k</m> for some <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>.
        In this case, <m>\text{ card} ( S ) = k</m>.
        We need to show that <m>A</m> is equivalent to a finite set.
        To do this, we define <m>g\x A \to f ( A )</m> by
        <m>g ( x ) = f ( x )</m> for each <m>x \in A</m>.
        Since <m>f</m> is an injection,
        we conclude that <m>g</m> is an injection.
        Now let <m>y \in f ( A )</m>.
        Then there exists an <m>a \in A</m> such that <m>f ( a ) = y</m>.
        But by the definition of <m>g</m>,
        this means that <m>g ( a ) = y</m>,
        and hence <m>g</m> is a surjection.
        This proves that <m>g</m> is a bijection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, we have proved that <m>A \approx f ( A )</m>.
        Since <m>f ( A )</m> is a subset of <m>\mathbb{N}_k</m>,
        we use <xref ref="L_subsetsofNk"></xref>
        to conclude that <m>f ( A )</m> is finite and <m>\text{ card} ( f ( A ) ) \leq k</m>.
        In addition, by <xref ref="T_equivfinitesets"></xref>,
        <m>A</m> is a finite set and <m>\text{ card} ( A ) = \text{ card} ( f ( A ) )</m>.
        This proves that <m>A</m> is a finite set and <m>\text{ card} ( A ) \leq \text{ card} ( S )</m>.

      <p>
        Let <m>B</m> be a finite set and assume that <m>A</m> is a proper subset of <m>B</m>.
        Since <m>A</m> is a proper subset of <m>B</m>,
        there exists an element <m>x</m> in <m>B - A</m>.

        Hence, we may conclude that <m>\text{ card}  ( A ) \leq \text{ card}  ( B ) - 1</m> and that

  <subsection>
    <title>The Pigeonhole Principle</title>
    <p>
      The last property of finite sets that we will consider in this section is often called the
      <term>Pigeonhole Principle</term>.
          <idx><h>Pigeonhole Principle</h></idx>
      The
      <q>pigeonhole</q>
      version of this property says,
      <q>If <m>m</m> pigeons go into <m>r</m> pigeonholes and <m>m > r</m>,
      then at least one pigeonhole has more than one pigeon.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this situation,
      we can think of the set of pigeons as being equivalent to a set <m>P</m> with cardinality <m>m</m> and the set of pigeonholes as being equivalent to a set <m>H</m> with cardinality <m>r</m>.
      We can then define a function
      <m>f\x P \to H</m> that maps each pigeon to its pigeonhole.
      The Pigeonhole Principle states that this function is not an injection.
      (It is not one-to-one since there are at least two pigeons
      <q>mapped</q>
      to the same pigeonhole.)
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_pigeonhole">
      <title>The Pigeonhole Principle</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be finite sets.
          If <m>\text{ card} ( A ) > \text{ card} ( B )</m>,
          then any function <m>f\x A \to B</m> is not an injection.
        </p>
      </statement>
    
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be finite sets.
        We will prove the contrapositive of the theorem, which is,
        if there exists a function
        <m>f\x A \to B</m> that is an injection,
        then <m>\text{ card} ( A ) \leq \text{ card} ( B )</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So assume that <m>f\x A \to B</m> is an injection.
        As in <xref ref="T_finitesubsets"></xref>,
        we define a function <m>g\x A \to f ( A )</m> by
        <m>g ( x ) = f ( x )</m> for each <m>x \in A</m>.
        As we saw in <xref ref="T_finitesubsets"></xref>,
        the function <m>g</m> is a bijection.
        But then <m>A \approx f ( A )</m> and <m>f ( A ) \subseteq B</m>.
        Hence, <m>\text{ card} ( A ) = \text{ card} \!\left( f ( A ) \right)</m> and 
        <m>\text{ card} \!\left( f ( A ) \right) \leq \text{ card} ( B )</m>.
        Hence, <m>\text{ card} ( A ) \leq \text{ card} ( B )</m>,
        and this proves the contrapositive.
        Hence, if <m>\text{ card} ( A ) > \text{ card} ( B )</m>,
        then any function <m>f\x A \to B</m> is not an injection.

            Remember that two ordered pairs are equal if and only if their corresponding 
            coordinates are equal. So if <m>\left( a_1, c_1 \right) , \left( a_2, c_2 \right) 
            \in A \times C</m> and <m>h \left( a_1, c_1 \right) = h \left( a_2, c_2 \right)</m>, then
            <m>\left( f \left( a_1 \right), g \left( c_1 \right) \right) =
            \left( f \left( a_2 \right), g \left( c_2 \right) \right)</m>. We can then conclude that
            <m>f \left( a_1 \right) = f \left( a_2 \right)</m> and 
            <m>g \left( c_1 \right) = g \left( c_2 \right)</m>. Since <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are 
            both injections, this means that <m>a_1 = a_2</m> and <m>c_1 = c_2</m> and therefore,
            <m>\left( a_1, c_1 \right) = \left( a_2, c_2 \right)</m>. This proves that <m>f</m> 
            is an injection.
            Now let <m>\left( b, d \right) \in B \times D</m>. Since <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are
