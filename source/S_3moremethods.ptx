      <p>
        The following statement was proven in <xref ref="exer_x2odd"/>
        in <xref ref="S_1direct"></xref>.
        <blockquote>
          If <m>n</m> is an odd integer, then <m>n^2</m> is an odd integer.
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now consider the following proposition:
        <blockquote>
          For each integer <m>n</m>, if <m>n^2</m> is an odd integer, then <m>n</m> is an odd integer.

    <title>Review of Direct Proofs</title>
    <idx><h>direct proof</h></idx>
          <idx><h>proof</h><h>direct</h></idx>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="S_1direct"></xref>
      and <xref ref="S_directproof"></xref>, we studied direct proofs
          
      of mathematical statements.
      Most of the statements we prove in mathematics are conditional statements that can be written 
      in the form <m>P \to Q</m>.
      A direct proof of a statement of the form <m>P \to Q</m> is based on the definition that a 
      conditional statement can only be false when the hypothesis,
      <m>P</m>, is true and the conclusion, <m>Q</m>, is false.
      Thus, if the conclusion is true whenever the hypothesis is true,
      then the conditional statement must be true.
      So, in a direct proof,
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            We start by assuming that <m>P</m> is true.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            From this assumption, we logically deduce that <m>Q</m> is true.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      We have used the so-called forward and backward method to discover how to logically 
      deduce <m>Q</m> from the assumption that <m>P</m> is true.

    <title>Proof Using the Contrapositive</title>
    <idx><h>contrapositive</h></idx>
    <idx><h>proof</h><h>contrapositive</h></idx>
    <p>    
      As we saw in <xref text="custom" ref="PA_attempt">Beginning Activity 1</xref>,
      it is sometimes difficult to construct a direct proof of a conditional statement.
      This is one reason we studied logical equivalencies in <xref ref="S_logequiv"></xref>.
      Knowing that two expressions are logically equivalent tells us that if we prove one,
      then we have also proven the other.
      In fact, once we know the truth value of a statement,
      then we know the truth value of any other statement that is logically equivalent to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most useful logical equivalencies in this regard is that a conditional statement 
      <m>P \to Q</m> is logically equivalent to its contrapositive,
      <m>\mynot Q \to \mynot P</m>.
      This means that if we prove the contrapositive of the conditional statement,
      then we have proven the conditional statement.
      The following are some important points to remember.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use a direct proof to prove that <m>\mynot Q \to \mynot P</m> is true.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Caution: One difficulty with this type of proof is in the formation of correct negations.
            (We need to be very careful doing this.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We might consider using a proof by contrapositive when the statements <m>P</m> and 
            <m>Q</m> are stated as negations.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection>
    <title>Writing Guidelines</title>
    <idx><h>writing guidelines</h></idx>
    <p>
      One of the basic rules of writing mathematical proofs is to keep the reader informed.
      So when we prove a result using the contrapositive,
      we indicate this within the first few lines of the proof.
      For example,
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            We will prove this theorem by proving its contrapositive.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We will prove the contrapositive of this statement.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition,
      make sure the reader knows the status of every assertion that you make.
      That is, make sure you state whether an assertion is an assumption of the theorem,
      a previously proven result, a well-known result,
      or something from the reader's mathematical background.
      Following is a completed proof of a statement from 
      <xref text="custom" ref="PA_attempt">Beginning Activity 1</xref>.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_n2odd">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For each integer <m>n</m>,
          if <m>n^2</m> is an even integer,
          then <m>n</m> is an even integer.
        </p>
      </statement>
    
    <proof>
      <p>
        We will prove this result by proving the contrapositive of the statement, which is
        <blockquote>
          For each integer <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is an odd integer, then <m>n^2</m> is an odd integer.
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in <xref ref="T_xyodd"></xref>,
        we have already proven that if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are odd integers,
        then <m>x \cdot y</m> is an odd integer.
        So using <m>x = y = n</m>,
        we can conclude that if <m>n</m> is an odd integer,
        then <m>n \cdot n</m>, or <m>n^2</m>, is an odd integer.
        We have thus proved the contrapositive of the theorem,
        and consequently,
        we have proved that if <m>n^2</m> is an even integer,
        then <m>n</m> is an even integer. 
      </p>
    </proof>
    </theorem>
  </subsection>

  <subsection>
    <title>Using Other Logical Equivalencies</title>
    <p>
      As was noted in <xref ref="S_logequiv"></xref>,
      there are several different logical equivalencies.
      Fortunately,
      there are only a small number that we often use when trying to write proofs,
      and many of these are listed in <xref ref="T_logequiv"></xref>
      at the end of <xref ref="S_logequiv"></xref>.
      We will illustrate the use of one of these logical equivalencies with the following proposition:
      <blockquote>
        For all real numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, if <m>a \ne 0</m> and <m>b \ne 0</m>, then 
        <m>ab \ne 0</m>.
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
      First, notice that the hypothesis and the conclusion of the conditional statement are stated 
      in the form of negations.
      This suggests that we consider the contrapositive.
      Care must be taken when we negate the hypothesis since it is a conjunction.
      We use one of De Morgan's Laws as follows:
      <me>
        \mynot  \left( {a \ne 0\; \wedge \;b \ne 0} \right) \equiv \left( {a = 0} \right) \vee 
        \left( {b = 0} \right)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <exercise xml:id="pr_contrapositive">
      <title>Using Another Logical Equivalency</title>
      
      <task xml:id="pr_contrapositive1">
        <statement>
        <p>
          In English, write the contrapositive of,
          <q>For all real numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
          if <m>a \ne 0</m> and <m>b \ne 0</m>, then <m>ab \ne 0</m>.</q>

          </p>

      <task xml:id="pr_contrapositive2">
        <statement>
        <p>
          The contrapositive is a conditional statement in the form 
          <m>X \to \left( {Y \vee Z} \right)</m>.
          The difficulty is that there is not much we can do with the hypothesis
          <m>\left( {ab = 0} \right)</m> since we know nothing else about the real numbers 
          <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
          However, if we knew that <m>a</m> was not equal to zero,
          then we could multiply both sides of the equation <m>ab = 0</m> by <m>\dfrac{1}{a}</m>.
          This suggests that we consider using the following logical equivalency based on a
          result in <xref ref="T_logequiv"></xref>:
          <me>
            X \to \left( {Y \vee Z} \right) \equiv \left( {X \wedge \mynot  Y} \right) \to Z
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In English, use this logical equivalency to write a statement that is logically 
          equivalent to the contrapositive from <xref ref="pr_contrapositive1"/>.
        </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            For all real numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
            if <m>ab = 0</m> and <m>a \ne 0</m>, <m>b = 0</m>.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </task>

      <task>
        <statement>
        <p>
          The logical equivalency in <xref ref="pr_contrapositive2"/> makes sense 
          because if we are trying to prove <m>Y \vee Z</m>,
          we only need to prove that at least one of <m>Y</m> or <m>Z</m> is true.
          So the idea is to prove that if <m>Y</m> is false,
          then <m>Z</m> must be true.

        <p>
          Use the ideas presented in the progress check to complete the proof of the following

                This contrapositive, however,
                is logically equivalent to the following: 
                <blockquote>
                  For all real numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
                  if <m>ab = 0</m> and <m>a \ne 0</m>, then <m>b = 0</m>.
                </blockquote>
                To prove this,
                we let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be real numbers and assume that 
                <m>ab = 0</m> and <m>a \ne 0</m>.
                We can then multiply both sides of the equation <m>ab = 0</m> by <m>\dfrac{1}{a}</m>.
                This gives 
                <me>
                  \text{Now complete the proof.}
                </me>
                <me>
                  \vdots
                </me>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Therefore, <m>b = 0</m>.
                This completes the proof of a statement that is logically equivalent to the 
                contrapositive,
                and hence,
                we have proven the proposition. 
             </p>
            </proof>
          </proposition>
        </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            This gives

              \frac{1}{a} (ab) = \frac{1}{a} \cdot 0
            </me>.
            We now use the associative property on the left side of this equation and simplify 
            both sides of the equation to obtain
            <md>
              <mrow>\left( \frac{1}{a} \cdot a \right)b \amp = 0</mrow>
              <mrow>1 \cdot b \amp = 0</mrow>
              <mrow>b \amp = 0</mrow>
            </md>
            Therefore, <m>b = 0</m> and this completes the proof of a statement that is 
            logically equivalent to the contrapositive.
            Hence, we have proved the proposition.

    <p>
      In <xref text="custom" ref="PA_biconditional">Beginning Activity 2</xref>,
      we used the following logical equivalency:
      <me>
        \left( {P \leftrightarrow Q} \right) \equiv \left( {P \to Q} \right) \wedge \left( {Q \to P} 
        \right)
      </me>.

      This logical equivalency suggests one method for proving a biconditional statement written in 
      the form
      <q><m>P</m> if and only if <m>Q</m>.</q>
      This method is to construct separate proofs of the two conditional statements <m>P \to Q</m> 
      and <m>Q \to P</m>.
      For example, since we have now proven each of the following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            For each integer <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is an even integer,
            then <m>n^2</m> is an even integer. (<xref ref="exer_x2odd"/> from <xref ref="exer_evenoddmult"/>
            in <xref ref="S_1direct"></xref>)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            For each integer <m>n</m>, if <m>n^2</m> is an even integer,
            then <m>n</m> is an even integer. (<xref ref="T_n2odd"></xref>)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      we can state the following theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_n2isodd">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For each integer <m>n</m>,
          <m>n</m> is an even integer if and only if <m>n^2</m> is an even integer.

    <title>Writing Guidelines</title>
      <idx><h>writing guidelines</h></idx>
    <p>
      When proving a biconditional statement using the logical equivalency
      <m>\left( {P \leftrightarrow Q} \right) \equiv \left( {P \to Q} \right) \wedge \left( {Q \to P} 
      \right)</m>,
      we actually need to prove two conditional statements.
      The proof of each conditional statement can be considered as one of two parts of the proof 
      of the biconditional statement.
      Make sure that the start and end of each of these parts is indicated clearly.
      This is illustrated in the proof of the following proposition.

    <proposition xml:id="P_iffexample">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>x \in \mathbb{R}</m>.
          The real number <m>x</m> equals 2 if and only if
          <m>x^3 - 2x^2 + x = 2</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We will prove this biconditional statement by proving the following two conditional statements:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              For each real number <m>x</m>,
              if <m>x</m> equals 2 , then <m>x^3 - 2x^2 + x = 2</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For each real number <m>x</m>,
              if <m>x^3 - 2x^2 + x = 2</m>, then <m>x</m> equals 2.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first part,
        we assume <m>x = 2</m> and prove that <m>x^3  - 2x^2  + x = 2</m>.
        We can do this by substituting <m>x = 2</m> into the expression <m>x^3  - 2x^2  + x</m>.
        This gives

        <md>
          <mrow>x^3  - 2x^2  + x \amp = 2^3  - 2\left( {2^2 } \right) + 2</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = 8 - 8 + 2</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp =2</mrow>
        </md>.

        This completes the first part of the proof.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the second part, we assume that
        <m>x^3  - 2x^2  + x = 2</m> and from this assumption,
        we will prove that <m>x = 2</m>.
        We will do this by solving this equation for <m>x</m>.
        To do so, we first rewrite the equation
        <m>x^3  - 2x^2  + x = 2</m> by subtracting 2 from both sides:
        <me>
          x^3  - 2x^2  + x - 2 = 0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can now factor the left side of this equation by factoring an <m>x^2</m> from the 
        first two terms and then factoring
        <m>\left( {x - 2} \right)</m> from the resulting two terms.
        This is shown below.

        <md>
          <mrow>x^3  - 2x^2  + x - 2 \amp = 0</mrow>
          <mrow>x^2 \left( {x - 2} \right) + \left( {x - 2} \right) \amp = 0</mrow>
          <mrow>\left( {x - 2} \right)\left( {x^2  + 1} \right) \amp = 0</mrow>
        </md>.

        Now, in the real numbers,
        if a product of two factors is equal to zero,
        then one of the factors must be zero.
        So this last equation implies that
        <me>
          x - 2 = 0\text{ or } x^2  + 1 = 0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The equation <m>x^2 + 1 = 0</m> has no real number solution.
        So since <m>x</m> is a real number,
        the only possibility is that <m>x - 2 = 0</m>.
        From this we can conclude that <m>x</m> must be equal to 2.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we have now proven both conditional statements,
        we have proven that <m>x = 2</m> if and only if <m>x^3 - 2x^2 + x = 2</m>. 
      </p>
    </proof>

    <title>Constructive Proofs</title>
      <idx><h>constructive proof</h></idx>
    <p>
      We all know how to solve an equation such as <m>3x + 8 = 23</m>,
      where <m>x</m> is a real number.
      To do so, we first add <m>-8</m> to both sides of the equation and then divide both 
      sides of the resulting equation by 3.
      Doing so, we obtain the following result:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      If <m>x</m> is a real number and <m>3x + 8 = 23</m>, then <m>x = 5</m>.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Notice that the process of solving the equation actually does not prove that
      <m>x = 5</m> is a solution of the equation <m>3x + 8 = 23</m>.
      This process really shows that if there is a solution,
      then that solution must be <m>x = 5</m>.
      To show that this is a solution,
      we use the process of substituting <m>5</m> for <m>x</m> in the left side of the 
      equation as follows: If <m>x = 5</m>, then
      <me>
        3x + 8 = 3 \left( 5 \right) + 8 = 15 + 8 = 23
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This proves that <m>x = 5</m> is a solution of the equation <m>3x + 8 = 23</m>.
      Hence, we have proven that <m>x = 5</m> is the only real number solution of <m>3x + 8 = 23</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can use this same process to show that any linear equation has a real number solution.
      An equation of the form
      <me>
        ax + b = c
      </me>,
      where <m>a</m>,
      <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> are real numbers with <m>a \ne 0</m>,
      is called a <term>linear equation in one variable</term>.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="P_linearequation">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>a</m>,
          <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> are real numbers with <m>a \ne 0</m>,
          then the linear equation <m>ax + b = c</m> has exactly one real number solution,
          which is <m>x = \dfrac{c - b}{a}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Assume that <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>,
        and <m>c</m> are real numbers with <m>a \ne 0</m>.
        We can solve the linear equation
        <m>ax + b = c</m> by adding <m>-b</m> to both sides of the equation and then dividing 
        both sides of the resulting equation by <m>a</m> <m>\left( \text{ since }  a \ne 0 \right)</m>,
        to obtain
        <me>
          x = \frac{c - b}{a}
        </me>.

        This shows that if there is a solution,
        then it must be <m>x = \dfrac{c - b}{a}</m>.
        We also see that if <m>x = \dfrac{c - b}{a}</m>, then

        <md>
          <mrow>ax + b \amp = a \left( \frac{c - b}{a} \right) + b</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = \left( c - b \right) + b</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = c</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, the linear equation
        <m>ax + b = c</m> has exactly one real number solution and the solution is 
        <m>x = \dfrac{c - b}{a}</m>.

      Another type of proof that is often used to prove an existence theorem is the so-called
      <term>nonconstructive proof.</term>
          
      For this type of proof, we make an argument that an object in the universal set that makes

      <m>P( x )</m> true.
      The advantage of a constructive proof over a nonconstructive proof is that the 
      constructive proof will yield a procedure or algorithm for obtaining the desired object.

    <idx><h>Intermediate Value Theorem</h></idx>
      The proof of the <term>Intermediate Value Theorem</term>
          
      from calculus is an example of a nonconstructive proof.
      The Intermediate Value Theorem can be stated as follows:
      <blockquote>
        If <m>f</m> is a continuous function on the closed interval <m>\left[ {a,b} \right]</m> 
        and if <m>q</m> is any real number strictly between <m>f( a )</m> and <m>f( b )</m>, 
        then there exists a number <m>c</m> in the interval <m>\left( {a,b} \right)</m> such that 
        <m>f( c ) = q</m>.
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Intermediate Value Theorem can be used to prove that a solution to some equations must exist.
      This is shown in the next example.
    </p>

    <example>
      <title>Using the Intermediate Value Theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>x</m> represent a real number.
          We will use the Intermediate Value Theorem to prove that the equation
          <m>x^3 - x + 1 = 0</m> has a real number solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          To investigate solutions of the equation
          <m>x^3  - x + 1 = 0</m>, we will use the function
          <me>
            f( x ) = x^3  - x + 1
          </me>.
  
          Notice that <m>f( { - 2} ) =  - 5</m> and that <m>f( 0 ) = 1</m>.
          Since <m>f ( -2 ) \lt  0</m> and <m>f ( 0 ) > 0</m>,
          the Intermediate Value Theorem tells us that there is a real number <m>c</m> between 
          <m>-2</m> and <m>0</m> such that <m>f( c ) = 0</m>.
          This means that there exists a real number <m>c</m> between <m>-2</m> and <m>0</m> such that
          <me>
            c^3  - c + 1 = 0
          </me>,
          and hence <m>c</m> is a real number solution of the equation <m>x^3  - x + 1 = 0</m>.
          This proves that the equation
          <m>x^3  - x + 1 = 0</m> has at least one real number solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that this proof does not tell us how to find the exact value of <m>c</m>.
          It does, however,
          suggest a method for approximating the value of <m>c</m>.
          This can be done by finding smaller and smaller intervals
          <m>\left[ {a,\;b} \right]</m> such that <m>f( a )</m> and <m>f( b )</m> have opposite signs.

      <title>Using a Logical Equivalency</title>
      <introduction>
      <p>
        Consider the following proposition:
        <proposition xml:id="prop-act1-32">
          <statement>
            <p>
              For all integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, if 3 does not divide <m>a</m> and 3 does not 
              divide <m>b</m>, then 3 does not divide the product <m>a \cdot b</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </proposition>
      </p>
      </introduction>

      <task>
        <p>
          Notice that the hypothesis of the proposition is stated as a conjunction of two negations (
          <q>3 does not divide <m>a</m> and 3 does not divide <m>b</m></q>).
          Also, the conclusion is stated as the negation of a sentence (
          <q>3 does not divide the product <m>a \cdot b</m>.</q>).
          This often indicates that we should consider using a proof of the contrapositive.
          If we use the symbolic form
          <m>\left( {\mynot Q \wedge \mynot R} \right) \to \mynot P</m> as a model for this proposition,
          what is <m>P</m>, what is <m>Q</m>, and what is <m>R</m>?

          Write the contrapositive of the proposition as a conditional statement in English.
