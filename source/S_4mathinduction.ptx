      <title>Beginning Activity 1: Exploring Statements of the Form 
      <m>\left( \forall n \in \N \right)\left( P(n) \right)</m></title>
      <p>
        One of the most fundamental sets in mathematics is the set of natural numbers <m>\N</m>.
        In this section, we will learn a new proof technique,
        called mathematical induction,
        that is often used to prove statements of the form 
        <m>\left( \forall n \in \N \right)\left( P(n) \right)</m>.
        In <xref ref="S_otherinduction"></xref>,
        we will learn how to extend this method to statements of the form 
        <m>\left( \forall n \in T \right)\left( P(n) \right)</m>,
        where <m>T</m> is a certain type of subset of the integers <m>\Z</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each natural number <m>n</m>,
        let <m>P(n)</m> be the following open sentence:
        <me>
          4 \text{ divides }   \left( {5^n  - 1} \right)\!
        </me>.
      </p> 
        <exercise>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Does this open sentence become a true statement when <m>n = 1</m>?
              That is, is 1 in the truth set of <m>P(n)</m>?
            </p>
          </statement>
        </exercise>
        <exercise>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Does this open sentence become a true statement when <m>n = 2</m>?
              That is, is 2 in the truth set of <m>P(n)</m>?
            </p>
          </statement>
        </exercise>
        <exercise>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Choose at least four more natural numbers and determine whether the open sentence is true or false for each of your choices.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </exercise>
      
      <p>
        All of the examples that were used should provide evidence that the following 
        proposition is true: 
        <me>
         \text{For each natural number } n, 4 \text{ divides } \left( {5^n - 1} \right)
        </me>.
        We should keep in mind that no matter how many examples we try,
        we cannot prove this proposition with a list of examples because we can never check 
        if 4 divides
        <m>\left( {5^n - 1} \right)</m> for every natural number <m>n</m>.
        Mathematical induction will provide a method for proving this proposition.
      </p>
      <p>
        For another example, for each natural number <m>n</m>,
        we now let <m>Q( n )</m> be the following open sentence:
        <men xml:id="eq_PAexplore">
          1^2  + 2^2  + \, \cdots \, + n^2  = \frac{{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}}{6}
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The expression on the left side of the previous equation is the sum of the squares 
        of the first <m>n</m> natural numbers.
        So when <m>n = 1</m>,
        the left side of equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_PAexplore"/> is <m>1^2</m>.
        When <m>n = 2</m>,
        the left side of equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_PAexplore"/> is <m>1^2 + 2^2</m>.

        All of the examples we have explored,
        should indicate the following proposition is true:

  <subsection xml:id="SS_inductive-sets">
    <title>Inductive Sets</title>
    <p>
      The two open sentences in <xref ref="PA_exploringstatements">Beginning Activity 1</xref>
      appeared to be true for all values of <m>n</m> in the set of natural numbers,
      <m>\mathbb{N}</m>.
      That is, the examples in this beginning activity provided evidence that the following 
      two statements are true.
      <ul>
        <li xml:id="conjecture1">
          <p>
            For each natural number <m>n</m>, 4 divides <m>\left( {5^n - 1} \right)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li xml:id="conjecture2">
          <p>
            For each natural number <m>n</m>,
            <m>1^2 + 2^2 + \, \cdots \, + n^2 = \dfrac{{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}}{6}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
  
      One way of proving statements of this form uses the concept of an inductive set 
      introduced in <xref ref="PA_propertyofN">Beginning Activity 2</xref>.
      The idea is to prove that if one natural number makes the open sentence true,
      then the next one also makes the open sentence true.
      This is how we handle the phrase
      <q>and so on</q>
      when dealing with the natural numbers.
      In <xref ref="PA_propertyofN">Beginning Activity 2</xref>,
      we saw that the number systems <m>\N</m> and <m>\Z</m> and other sets are inductive.
      What we are trying to do is somehow distinguish <m>\N</m> from the other inductive sets.
      The way to do this was suggested in <xref ref="PA_propertyofN6"></xref> of 
      <xref ref="PA_propertyofN">Beginning Activity 2</xref>.
      Although we will not prove it,
      the following statement should seem true.
      <blockquote xml:id="inductivestatement1">
        
        <p>
          Statement 1: For each subset <m>T</m> of <m>\N</m>,
          if <m>1 \in T</m> and <m>T</m> is inductive,
          then <m>T = \mathbb{N}</m>.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      Notice that the integers, <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>,
      and the set <m>S = \left\{ {n \in \mathbb{Z} \mid n \geq - 3} \right\}</m> 
      both contain 1 and both are inductive,
      but they both contain numbers other than natural numbers.
      For example, the following statement is false:
      <blockquote xml:id="inductivestatement2">
        
        <p>
          Statement 2: For each subset <m>T</m> of <m>\Z</m>,
          if <m>1 \in T</m> and <m>T</m> is inductive,
          then <m>T = \mathbb{Z}</m>.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      The set <m>S = \left\{ {n \in \mathbb{Z} \mid n \geq - 3} \right\} = 
      \left\{ { -3, -2, -1,0,1,2,3, \ldots \: } \right\}</m> 
      is a counterexample that shows that this statement is false.

    <title>The Principle of Mathematical Induction</title>
    <p>
      Although we proved that <xref ref="inductivestatement2">Statement 2</xref> is false, in this text,
      we will not prove that <xref ref="inductivestatement1">Statement 1</xref> is true.
      One reason for this is that we really do not have a formal definition of the natural numbers.
      However, we should be convinced that <xref ref="inductivestatement1">Statement 1</xref> is true.
      We resolve this by making <xref ref="inductivestatement1">Statement 1</xref> an axiom for the natural 
      numbers so that this becomes one of the defining characteristics of the natural numbers.

    <title>Using the Principle of Mathematical Induction</title>
    <p>
      The primary use of the Principle of Mathematical Induction is to prove statements of the 
      form
      <me>
        \left( {\forall n \in \mathbb{N}} \right)\left( {P\left( n \right)} \right)
      </me>,
      where <m>P( n )</m> is some open sentence.
      Recall that a universally quantified statement like the preceding one is true 
      if and only if the truth set <m>T</m> of the open sentence <m>P( n )</m> is the set <m>\N</m>.
      So our goal is to prove that <m>T = \N</m>,
      which is the conclusion of <xref ref="principle-math-induction"/>
      To verify the hypothesis of the <xref ref="principle-math-induction"/>, we must
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Prove that <m>1 \in T</m>.
            That is, prove that <m>P( 1 )</m> is true.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Prove that if <m>k \in T</m>,
            then <m>\left( {k + 1} \right) \in T</m>.
            That is, prove that if <m>P( k )</m> is true,
            then <m>P( {k + 1} )</m> is true.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
  
      The first step is called the <term>basis step</term>
      <idx><h>mathematical induction</h><h>basis step</h></idx>
          <idx><h>basis step</h></idx>
      or the <term>initial step</term>,
      and the second step is called the
      <term>inductive step</term>.
          <idx><h>mathematical induction</h><h>inductive step</h></idx>
          <idx><h>inductive step</h></idx>
      This means that a proof by mathematical induction will have the following form:

      
    
    <observation xml:id="proced-induct">
      <title>Procedure for a Proof by Mathematical Induction</title>
      <statement>
        <p>

        <p>
          Basis step: Prove  <m>P( 1 )</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inductive step: Prove that for each  <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>, 
          if <m>P( k )</m> is true, then <m>P( {k + 1} )</m> is true.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can then conclude that <m>P( n )</m> is true for all <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </observation>
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that in the inductive step,
      we want to prove that the conditional statement
      <q>for each <m>k \in \N</m>, if <m>P(k)</m> then <m>P(k + 1)</m></q>
      is true.
      So we will start the inductive step by assuming that <m>P( k )</m> is true.
      This assumption is called the <term>inductive assumption</term>
          <idx><h>inductive assumption</h></idx>
      or the <term>inductive hypothesis.</term>
          <idx><h>inductive hypothesis</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>
      The key to constructing a proof by induction is to discover how
      <m>P( {k + 1} )</m> is related to <m>P( k )</m> for an arbitrary natural number <m>k</m>.
      For example,
      in <xref ref="PA_exploringstatements">Beginning Activity 1</xref>,
      one of the open sentences <m>P(n)</m> was
      <me>
        1^2  + 2^2  + \, \cdots \, + n^2  = \frac{{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}}{6}
      </me>.

      Sometimes it helps to look at some specific examples such as <m>P( 2 )</m> and <m>P( 3 )</m>.
      The idea is not just to do the computations,
      but to see how the statements are related.
      This can sometimes be done by writing the details instead of immediately doing computations.
      <md>
        <mrow>P(2) \amp \qquad \text{ is }  \amp  1^2  + 2^2  \amp = \dfrac{{2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5}}{6}</mrow>
        <mrow>P(3) \amp \qquad \text{ is }  \amp  1^2  + 2^2  + 3^2  \amp = \dfrac{{3 \cdot 4 \cdot 7}}{6}</mrow>
      </md>.
 
      In this case, the key is the left side of each equation.
      The left side of <m>P( 3 )</m> is obtained from the left side of <m>P( 2 )</m> by 
      adding one term,
      which is <m>3^2</m>.
      This suggests that we might be able to obtain the equation for <m>P( 3 )</m> by adding 
      <m>3^2</m> to both sides of the equation in <m>P( 2 )</m>.
      Now for the general case, if <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>,
      we look at <m>P( {k + 1})</m> and compare it to <m>P( k )</m>.
      <md>
        <mrow>P(k)  \amp  \text{ is }  \amp  1^2  + 2^2  +  \cdots  + k^2  \amp = \dfrac{{k(k + 1)(2k + 1)}}{6}</mrow>
        <mrow>P(k+1)  \amp  \text{ is }  \amp  1^2  + 2^2  +  \cdots  + \left( {k + 1} \right)^2  \amp = \dfrac{{\left( {k + 1} \right)\left[ {\left( {k + 1} \right) + 1} \right]\left[ {2\left( {k + 1} \right) + 1} \right]}}{6}</mrow>
      </md>

      The key is to look at the left side of the equation for
      <m>P( {k + 1} )</m> and realize what this notation means.
      It means that we are adding the squares of the first <m>\left( {k + 1} \right)</m> 
      natural numbers.
      This means that we can write
      <me>
        1^2  + 2^2  + \, \cdots \, + \left( {k + 1} \right)^2  = 1^2  + 2^2  + \, 
        \cdots \, + k^2  + \left( {k + 1} \right)^2
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This shows us that the left side of the equation for
      <m>P( {k + 1} )</m> can be obtained from the left side of the equation for <m>P( k )</m> by adding <m>\left( {k + 1} \right)^2</m>.
      This is the motivation for proving the inductive step in the following proof.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="P_suminduction">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For each natural number <m>n</m>,
          <me>
            1^2  + 2^2  + \, \cdots \, + n^2  = \dfrac{{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}}{6}
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    
    <proof>
      <p>
        We will use a proof by mathematical induction.
        For each natural number <m>n</m>, we let <m>P( n )</m> be
        <me>
          1^2  + 2^2  +  \cdots  + n^2  = \dfrac{{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}}{6}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We first prove that <m>P ( 1 )</m> is true.
        Notice that <m>\dfrac{{1\left( {1 + 1} \right)\left( {2 \cdot 1 + 1} \right)}}{6} = 1</m>.
        This shows that
        <me>
          1^2  = \dfrac{{1\left( {1 + 1} \right)\left( {2 \cdot 1 + 1} \right)}}{6}
        </me>,
        which proves that <m>P( 1 )</m> is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the inductive step, we prove that for each <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>,
        if <m>P ( k )</m> is true, then <m>P( k + 1 )</m> is true.
        So let <m>k</m> be a natural number and assume that <m>P( k )</m> is true.
        That is, assume that
        <men xml:id="eq_suminduction1">
          1^2  + 2^2  +  \cdots  + k^2  = \frac{{k(k + 1)(2k + 1)}}{6}
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal now is to prove that <m>P\left( {k + 1} \right)</m> is true.
        That is, it must be proved that
        <mdn>
          <mrow number="no">1^2  + 2^2  + \, \cdots \, + k^2 + (k + 1)^2  
            \amp = \frac{{(k + 1)\left[ {(k + 1) + 1} \right]\left[ {2(k + 1) + 1} \right]}}{6}</mrow>
          <mrow xml:id="eq_suminduction2">\amp = \frac{{(k + 1)\left( k + 2\right) \left( 2k + 3 \right)}}{6}</mrow>
        </mdn>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To do this, we add <m>\left( {k + 1} \right)^2</m> to both sides of 
        equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_suminduction1"/> and algebraically rewrite the right 
        side of the resulting equation.
        This gives
        <md>
          <mrow>1^2  + 2^2  +  \cdots  + k^2  + (k + 1)^2 \amp = \frac{{k(k + 1)(2k + 1)}}{6} + (k + 1)^2</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = \frac{{k(k + 1)(2k + 1) + 6(k + 1)^2 }}{6}</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = \frac{{(k + 1)\left[ {k(2k + 1) + 6(k + 1)} \right]}}{6}</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = \frac{{(k + 1)\left( {2k^2  + 7k + 6} \right)}}{6}</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = \frac{{(k + 1)(k + 2)(2k + 3)}}{6}</mrow>
        </md>.

        Comparing this result to equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_suminduction2"/>,
        we see that if <m>P( k )</m> is true,
        then <m>P( {k + 1} )</m> is true.
        Hence, the inductive step has been established,
        and by the <xref ref="principle-math-induction"/>,
        we have proved that for each natural number <m>n</m>,
        <m>1^2 + 2^2 + \, \cdots \, + n^2 = \dfrac{{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}}{6}</m>.

          <idx><h>writing guidelines</h></idx>
      The proof of <xref ref="P_suminduction"></xref> shows a standard way to write an 
      induction proof.
      When writing a proof by mathematical induction,
      we should follow the guideline that we always keep the reader informed.
      This means that at the beginning of the proof,
      we should state that a proof by induction will be used.
      We should then clearly define the open sentence <m>P ( n )</m> that will be used in 
      the proof.
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Summation Notation</title>
    <p>
      The result in <xref ref="P_suminduction"></xref>
      could be written using summation notation as follows: 
      <blockquote>
        For each natural number <m>n</m>,
        <m>\sum\limits_{j = 1}^n {j^2 } = \dfrac{{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}}{6}</m>.
      </blockquote>
 
      In this case, we use <m>j</m> for the index for the summation,
      and the notation <m>\sum\limits_{j = 1}^n {j^2 }</m> tells us to add all the values of 
      <m>j^2</m> for <m>j</m> from 1 to <m>n</m>,
      inclusive.
      That is,
      <me>
        \sum\limits_{j = 1}^n {j^2 }  = 1^2  + 2^2  +  \cdots  + n^2
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So in the proof of <xref ref="P_suminduction"></xref>,
      we would let <m>P( n )</m> be 
      <m>\sum\limits_{j = 1}^n {j^2 }  = \dfrac{{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}}{6}</m>,
      and we would use the fact that for each natural number <m>k</m>,
      <me>
        \sum\limits_{j = 1}^{k + 1} {j^2 }  = \left( {\sum\limits_{j = 1}^k {j^2 } } \right) + \left( {k + 1} \right)^2

          The basis step is an essential part of a proof by induction.
          See <xref ref="exer_basis"/> for an example that shows that the basis step is 
          needed in a proof by induction.

          It is important to remember that the inductive step in an induction proof is a 
          proof of a conditional statement.
          Although we did not explicitly use the forward-backward process in the inductive 
          step for <xref ref="P_suminduction"></xref>,
          it was implicitly used in the discussion prior to <xref ref="P_suminduction"></xref>.
          The key question was,
          <q>How does knowing the sum of the first <m>k</m> squares help us find the sum of 
          the first <m>\left( {k + 1} \right)</m> squares?</q>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When proving the inductive step in a proof by induction,
          the key question is, 
          <blockquote>
            How does knowing  <m>P(  k )</m> help us prove  <m>P( {k + 1} )</m>?
          </blockquote>
          In <xref ref="P_suminduction"></xref>,
          we were able to see that the way to answer this question was to add a certain 
          expression to both sides of the equation given in  <m>P(  k )</m>.
          Sometimes the relationship between  <m>P(  k )</m>  and
          <m>P( {k + 1} )</m> is not as easy to see.
          For example,
          in <xref ref="PA_exploringstatements">Beginning Activity 1</xref>,
          we explored the following proposition: 
          <blockquote>
            For each natural number <m>n</m>,  4  divides  <m>\left( {5^n  - 1} \right)</m>.
          </blockquote>
          This means that the open sentence, <m>P( n )</m>, is
          <q>4  divides  <m>\left( {5^n  - 1} \right)</m>.</q>
          So in the inductive step,
          we assume  <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m> and that  4  divides  <m>\left( {5^k  - 1} \right)</m>.
          This means that there exists an integer  <m>m</m>  such that
          <men xml:id="eq_5a">
            5^k  - 1 = 4m
          </men>.
          In the backward process,
          the goal is to prove that 4 divides <m>\left( {5^{k + 1}  - 1} \right)</m>.
          This can be accomplished if we can prove that there exists an integer <m>s</m> 
          such that
          <men xml:id="eq_5b">
            5^{k + 1}  - 1 = 4s
          </men>.
          We now need to see if there is anything in equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_5a"/> that 
          can be used in equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_5b"/>.
          The key is to find something in the equation
          <m>5^k - 1 = 4m</m> that is related to something similar in the equation 
          <m>5^{k + 1}  - 1 = 4s</m>.
          In this case, we notice that
          <me>
            5^{k + 1}  = 5 \cdot 5^k
          </me>.
          So if we can solve <m>5^k  - 1 = 4m</m>  for  <m>5^k</m>,
          we could make a substitution for <m>5^k</m>.
          This is done in the proof of the following proposition.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <proposition xml:id="P_divideinduction">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For every natural number <m>n</m>, 4 divides <m>\left( {5^n - 1} \right)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    
    <proof>
      <p>
        (Proof by Mathematical Induction) For each natural number <m>n</m>,
        let <m>P( n )</m> be
        <q>4 divides <m>\left( {5^n - 1} \right)</m>.</q>
        We first prove that <m>P \left( 1 \right)</m> is true.
        Notice that when <m>n = 1</m>,
        <m>\left( {5^n - 1} \right) = 4</m>.
        Since 4 divides 4, <m>P\left( 1 \right)</m> is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the inductive step, we prove that for all <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>,
        if <m>P \left( k \right)</m> is true,
        then <m>P \left( k + 1 \right)</m> is true.
        So let <m>k</m> be a natural number and assume that <m>P(  k )</m> is true.
        That is, assume that
        <me>
          4\text{  divides  } \left( {5^k  - 1} \right)
        </me>.
 
        This means that there exists an integer <m>m</m> such that
        <me>
          5^k  - 1 = 4m
        </me>.
 
        Thus,
        <men xml:id="eq_5c">
          5^k  = 4m + 1
        </men>.

        In order to prove that <m>P( k + 1 )</m> is true,
        we must show that 4 divides <m>\left( {5^{k + 1}  - 1} \right)</m>.
        Since <m>5^{k + 1}  = 5 \cdot 5^k</m>, we can write
        <men xml:id="eq_5d">
          5^{k + 1}  - 1 = 5 \cdot 5^k  - 1
        </men>.
 
        We now substitute the expression for <m>5^k</m> from equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_5c"/> into equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_5d"/>.
        This gives
        <mdn>
          <mrow number="no">5^{k + 1}  - 1 \amp = 5 \cdot 5^k  - 1</mrow>
          <mrow number="no">\amp = 5( {4m + 1} ) - 1</mrow>
          <mrow number="no">\amp = ( {20m + 5} ) - 1</mrow>
          <mrow number="no">\amp = 20m + 4</mrow>
          <mrow xml:id="eq_5e">\amp = 4( {5m + 1} )</mrow>
        </mdn>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>\left( {5m + 1} \right)</m> is an integer,
        equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_5e"/> shows that 4 divides <m>\left( {5^{k + 1} - 1} \right)</m>.
        Therefore, if <m>P( k )</m> is true,
        then <m>P( k + 1 )</m> is true and the inductive step has been established.
        Thus, by <xref ref="principle-math-induction"/>,
        for every natural number <m>n</m>, 4 divides <m>\left( {5^n - 1} \right)</m>.
        
      </p>
    </proof>
    </proposition>

    <p>
      <xref ref="P_divideinduction"></xref> was stated in terms of
      <q>divides.</q>
      We can use congruence to state a proposition that is equivalent to 
      <xref ref="P_divideinduction"></xref>.
      The idea is that the sentence, 4 divides
      <m>\left(5^n - 1 \right)</m> means that <m>5^n \equiv 1 \pmod 4</m>.
      So the following proposition is equivalent to <xref ref="P_divideinduction"></xref>.

      </statement>

      Since we have proved <xref ref="P_divideinduction"></xref>,

              <p>
                For each  <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>, let  <m>P( n )</m> be,
                <m>2 + 5 + 8 +  \cdots  + (3n - 1) = \dfrac{{n( {3n + 1} )}}{2}</m>. 
                When we use <m>n = 1</m>, the summation on the left side of the equation is 2, 
                and the right side is <m>\dfrac{1(3 \cdot 1 + 1)}{2} = 2</m>.  Therefore, 
                <m>P( 1 )</m>  is true.   For the inductive step, let <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>

                <me>
                  2 + 5 + 8 + \cdots  + \left( {3k - 1} \right) = \frac{{k \left( {3k + 1} \right)}}{2}

                We now add <m>3 \left( k + 1 \right) - 1</m> to both sides of this equation. 
                This gives

                If we now combine the terms on the right side of the equation into a single

                This proves that if  <m>P\left( k \right)</m> is true, then

                <q><m>4^n \equiv 1 \pmod 3</m>.</q>
                Since <m>4^1 \equiv 1 \pmod 3</m>,
                we see that <m>P(1)</m> is true.
                Now let <m>k \in \N</m> and assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true.
                That is, assume that

                  4^k \equiv 1 \pmod 3
                </me>.
                Multiplying both sides of this congruence by 4 gives
                <me>
                  4^{k+1} \equiv 4 \pmod 3
                </me>.
                However, <m>4 \equiv 1 \pmod 3</m> and so by using the transitive property of 
                congruence,
                we see that <m>4^{k+1} \equiv 1 \pmod 3</m>.
                This proves that if <m>P(k)</m> is true,
                then <m>P(k+1)</m> is true.

                We now assume that <m>P( k )</m> is true.
                That is,

                We will prove this proposition using mathematical induction.

              <p>
                Any set of <m>n</m> dogs consists entirely of dogs of the same breed.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will prove that for each natural number <m>n</m>,
                <m>P( n )</m> is true, which will prove that all dogs are the same breed.
                A set with only one dog consists entirely of dogs of the same breed and,
                hence, <m>P( 1 )</m> is true.
              </p>
              <p>
                So we let <m>k</m> be a natural number and assume that <m>P( k )</m> is true, that is,
                that every set of <m>k</m> dogs consists of dogs of the same breed.
                Now consider a set <m>D</m> of <m>k + 1</m> dogs, where
                <me>
                  D = \left\{ d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k, d_{k+1} \right\}\!
                </me>.
              </p>
              <p>
                If we remove the dog <m>d_1</m> from the set <m>D</m>,
                we then have a set <m>D_1</m> of <m>k</m> dogs,
                and using the assumption that <m>P( k )</m> is true,
                these dogs must all be of the same breed.
                Similarly, if we remove <m>d_{k+1}</m> from the set <m>D</m>,
                we again have a set <m>D_2</m> of <m>k</m> dogs,
                and these dogs must all be of the same breed.
                Since <m>D = D_1 \cup D_2</m>,
                we have proved that all of the dogs in <m>D</m> must be of the same breed.
              </p>
              <p>
                This proves that if <m>P( k )</m> is true,
                then <m>P( k + 1 )</m> is true and, hence,
                by mathematical induction,
                we have proved that for each natural number <m>n</m>,
                any set of <m>n</m> dogs consists entirely of dogs of the same breed.

      <title>The Importance of the Basis Step</title>
      
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Most of the work done in constructing a proof by induction is usually in proving the 
          inductive step.
          This was certainly the case in <xref ref="P_suminduction"></xref>.
          However, the basis step is an essential part of the proof.
          Without it, the proof is incomplete.
          To see this, let <m>P( n )</m> be
          <me>
            1 + 2 +  \cdots  + n = \frac{{n^2  + n + 1}}{2}
          </me>.
        </p>
      </introduction>

      <task>
        <p>
          Let  <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>.
          Complete the following proof that if  <m>P(  k )</m> is true,
          then  <m>P( k + 1 )</m> is true.
          Let  <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>.
          Assume that  <m>P(  k )</m> is true.
          That is, assume that
          <men xml:id="eq_act16a">
            1 + 2 +  \cdots  + k = \frac{{k^2  + k + 1}}{2}
          </men>.
          The goal is to prove that  <m>P( k + 1 )</m> is true.
          That is, we need to prove that
          <men xml:id="eq_act16b">
            1 + 2 +  \cdots  + k + \left( {k + 1} \right) = \frac{{\left( {k + 1} \right)^2  + \left( {k + 1} \right) + 1}}{2}
          </men>.
          To do this, we add  <m>\left( {k + 1} \right)</m> to both sides of 
          equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_act16a"/>.
