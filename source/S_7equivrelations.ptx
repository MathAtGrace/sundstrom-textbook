      <p>
        In previous mathematics courses,
        we have worked with the equality relation.
        For example,
        let <m>R</m> be the relation on <m>\Z</m> defined as follows: For all <m>a,
        b \in \Z</m>,
        <m>a \mathrel{R} b</m> if and only if <m>a = b</m>.
        We know this equality relation on <m>\Z</m> has the following properties:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              For each <m>a \in \Z</m>, <m>a = a</m> and so <m>a \mathrel{R} a</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For all <m>a, b \in \Z</m>, if <m>a = b</m>, then <m>b = a</m>.
              That is, if <m>a \mathrel{R} b</m>,
              then <m>b \mathrel{R} a</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For all <m>a, b, c \in \Z</m>,
              if <m>a = b</m> and <m>b = c</m>, then <m>a = c</m>.
              That is, if <m>a \mathrel{R} b</m> and <m>b \mathrel{R} c</m>,
              then <m>a \mathrel{R} c</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        In mathematics, when something satisfies certain properties,
        we often ask if other things satisfy the same properties.
        Before investigating this, we will give names to these properties.

        Before exploring examples, for each of these properties,
        it is a good idea to understand what it means to say that a relation does not satisfy 
        the property.
        So let <m>A</m> be a nonempty set and let <m>R</m> be a relation on <m>A</m>.

  <subsection>
    <title>Directed Graphs and Properties of Relations</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="S_relations"></xref>, we used directed graphs,
      or digraphs, to represent relations on finite sets.
      Three properties of relations were introduced in 
      <xref text="custom" ref="PA_propsofrelaitons">Beginning Activity 1</xref>
      and will be repeated in the following descriptions of how these properties can be 
      visualized on a directed graph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>A</m> be a nonempty set and let <m>R</m> be a relation on <m>A</m>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The relation <m>R</m> is <term>reflexive on <m>\boldsymbol{A}</m></term>
              <idx><h>reflexive</h></idx>
              <idx><h>relation</h><h>reflexive on</h></idx> 
            provided that for each <m>x \in A</m>, <m>x \mathrel{R} x</m> or, equivalently, 
            <m>\left( {x, x} \right) \in R</m>.
            This means that if a reflexive relation is represented on a digraph,
            there would have to be a loop at each vertex,
            as is shown in the following figure.
            
              <image width="25%" source="figps-reflexive"/>
              <!-- A piece of a digraph (the loop). -->
            
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The relation <m>R</m> is <term>symmetric</term>
              <idx><h>symmetric</h></idx>
              <idx><h>relation</h><h>symmetric</h></idx>
            provided that for every <m>x,
            y \in A</m>, if <m>x \mathrel{R} y</m>,
            then <m>y \mathrel{R} x</m> or, equivalently,
            for every <m>x, y \in A</m>,
            if <m>\left( {x, y} \right) \in R</m>,
            then <m>\left( {y, x} \right) \in R</m>.
            This means that if a symmetric relation is represented on a digraph,
            then anytime there is a directed edge from one vertex to a second vertex,
            there would be a directed edge from the second vertex to the first vertex,
            as is shown in the following figure.
            
              <image width="50%" source="figps-symmetric"/>
              <!-- A piece of a digraph (two line from one vertex to another). -->
            
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The relation <m>R</m> is <term>transitive</term>
              <idx><h>transitive</h></idx>
              <idx><h>relation</h><h>transitive</h></idx>
            provided that for every <m>x, y, z \in A</m>,
            if <m>x \mathrel{R} y</m> and <m>y \mathrel{R} z</m>,
            then <m>x \mathrel{R} z</m> or, equivalently,
            for every <m>x, y, z \in A</m>,
            if <m>\left( {x, y} \right) \in R</m> and <m>\left( {y, z} \right) \in R</m>,
            then <m>\left( {x, z} \right) \in R</m>.
            So if a transitive relation is represented by a digraph,
            then anytime there is a directed edge from a vertex <m>x</m> to a vertex <m>y</m> 
            and a directed edge from <m>y</m> to a vertex <m>z</m>,
            there would be a directed edge from <m>x</m> to <m>z</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition,
            if a transitive relation is represented by a digraph,
            then anytime there is a directed edge from a vertex <m>x</m> to a vertex <m>y</m> 
            and a directed edge from <m>y</m> to the vertex <m>x</m>,
            there would be loops at <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
            These two situations are illustrated as follows:
            
              <image width="70%" source="figps-transitive"/>
              <!-- A part of a digraph as explained here. -->

    <title>Definition of an Equivalence Relation</title>
    <p>
      In mathematics, as in real life,
      it is often convenient to think of two different things as being essentially the same.
      For example, when you go to a store to buy a cold soft drink,
      the cans of soft drinks in the cooler are often sorted by brand and type of soft drink.
      The Coca Colas are grouped together,
      the Pepsi Colas are grouped together, the Dr.
      Peppers are grouped together, and so on.
      When we choose a particular can of one type of soft drink,
      we are assuming that all the cans are essentially the same.
      Even though the specific cans of one type of soft drink are physically different,
      it makes no difference which can we choose.
      In doing this,
      we are saying that the cans of one type of soft drink are equivalent,
      and we are using the mathematical notion of an equivalence relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      An equivalence relation on a set is a relation with a certain combination of properties 
      that allow us to sort the elements of the set into certain classes.
      In this section,
      we will focus on the properties that define an equivalence relation,
      and in the next section,
      we will see how these properties allow us to sort or partition the elements of the set 
      into certain classes.
    </p>

    <assemblage xml:id="equivalencerelation">
      <title>Definition</title>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a nonempty set.
          A relation <m>\sim</m> on the set <m>A</m> is an

          provided that <m>\sim</m> is reflexive,
          symmetric, and transitive.
          For <m>a, b \in A</m>,
          if <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>A</m> and <m>a \sim b</m>,
          we say that <m>\boldsymbol{a}</m>
          <term>is equivalent to <m>\boldsymbol{b}</m></term>.

    </assemblage>

    <p>
      Most of the examples we have studied so far have involved a relation on a small finite set.
      For these examples,
      it was convenient to use a directed graph to represent the relation.
      It is now time to look at some other type of examples,
      which may prove to be more interesting.
      In these examples,
      keep in mind that there is a subtle difference between the reflexive property and the 
      other two properties.
      The reflexive property states that some ordered pairs actually belong to the relation <m>R</m>,
      or some elements of <m>A</m> are related.
      The reflexive property has a universal quantifier and, hence,
      we must prove that for all <m>x \in A</m>, <m>x \mathrel{R} x</m>.
      Symmetry and transitivity,
      on the other hand, are defined by conditional sentences.
      We often use a direct proof for these properties,
      and so we start by assuming the hypothesis and then showing that the conclusion must

      <title>A Relation that Is Not an Equivalence Relation</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>M</m> be the relation on <m>\mathbb{Z}</m> defined as follows:
          <blockquote>
            For <m>a, b \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>a \mathrel{M} b</m> if and only if <m>a</m> 
            is a multiple of <m>b</m>.
          </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
          So <m>a \mathrel{M} b</m> if and only if there exists a

                The relation <m>M</m> is reflexive on

                <m>x = x \cdot 1</m> and, hence, <m>x \mathrel{M} x</m>.

                but <m>2 \mathrel{\not \negthickspace M} 4</m>.
                So there exist integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> such that

                Hence, the relation <m>M</m> is not symmetric.

            <li>
              <p>
                Now assume that  <m>x \mathrel{M} y</m> and  <m>y \mathrel{M} z</m>.
                Then there exist integers  <m>p</m>  and  <m>q</m>  such that

                  x = y  p\text{  and  } y = z q

                Using the second equation to make a substitution in the first equation,
                we see that <m>x = z \left( {p q} \right)</m>.
                Since  <m>p q \in \mathbb{Z}</m>,
                we have shown that  <m>x</m>  is a multiple of  <m>z</m> and hence  <m>x \mathrel{M} z</m>.
                Therefore,  <m>M</m>  is a transitive relation.

      The relation <m>M</m> is reflexive on <m>\Z</m> and is transitive,

    <title>Congruence Modulo <m>\boldsymbol{n}</m></title>
    <p>
      One of the important equivalence relations we will study in detail is that of congruence
          <idx><h>congruence</h></idx>
      modulo <m>n</m>.
      We reviewed this relation in <xref text="custom" ref="PA_reviewofcongruence">Beginning Activity 2</xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="T_modprops"></xref>
      tells us that congruence modulo <m>n</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>.
      Recall that by the Division Algorithm,
      if <m>a \in \mathbb{Z}</m>,
      then there exist unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that
      <me>
        a = nq + r \text{  and  } 0 \leq r \lt  n
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="T_congtorem"></xref>
      and <xref ref="C_congtorem"></xref>
      then tell us that <m>a \equiv r \pmod n</m>.
      That is, <m>a</m> is congruent modulo <m>n</m> to its remainder <m>r</m> when it is 
      divided by <m>n</m>.
      When we use the term
      <q>remainder</q>
      in this context, we always mean the remainder <m>r</m> with
      <m>0 \leq r \lt n</m> that is guaranteed by the Division Algorithm.
      We can use this idea to prove the following theorem.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="T_congruence-remainder">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m> and let <m>a, b \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
          Then <m>a \equiv b \pmod n</m> if and only if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have the same 
          remainder when divided by <m>n</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
   
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m> and let <m>a, b \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
        We will first prove that if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have the same remainder when divided 
        by <m>n</m>,
        then <m>a \equiv b \pmod n</m>.
        So assume that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have the same remainder when divided by <m>n</m>,
        and let <m>r</m> be this common remainder.
        Then, by <xref ref="T_congtorem"></xref>,
        <me>
          a \equiv r \pmod n \text{  and  } b \equiv r \pmod n\!
        </me>.

        Since congruence modulo <m>n</m> is an equivalence relation,
        it is a symmetric relation.
        Hence, since <m>b \equiv r \pmod n</m>,
        we can conclude that <m>r \equiv b \pmod n</m>.
        Combining this with the fact that <m>a \equiv r \pmod n</m>,
        we now have
        <me>
          a \equiv r \pmod n\text{  and  } r \equiv b \pmod n\!
        </me>.

        We can now use the transitive property to conclude that <m>a \equiv b \pmod n</m>.
        This proves that if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have the same remainder when divided by <m>n</m>, then
        <m>a \equiv b \pmod n</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will now prove that if <m>a \equiv b \pmod n</m>,
        then <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have the same remainder when divided by <m>n</m>.
        Assume that <m>a \equiv b \pmod n</m>,
        and let <m>r</m> be the least nonnegative remainder when <m>b</m> is divided by <m>n</m>.
        Then <m>0 \leq r \lt  n</m> and,
        by <xref ref="T_congtorem"></xref>,
        <me>
          b \equiv r \pmod n\!
        </me>.

        Now, using the facts that <m>a \equiv b \pmod n</m> and <m>b \equiv r \pmod n</m>,
        we can use the transitive property to conclude that
        <me>
          a \equiv r \pmod n\!
        </me>.

        This means that there exists an integer <m>q</m> such that <m>a - r = nq</m> or that
        <me>
          a = nq + r
        </me>.

        Since we already know that <m>0 \leq r \lt n</m>,
        the last equation tells us that <m>r</m> is the least nonnegative remainder when 
        <m>a</m> is divided by <m>n</m>.
        Hence we have proven that if <m>a \equiv b \pmod n</m>,
        then <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have the same remainder when divided by <m>n</m>. 
      </p>

          The relation <m>\sim</m> on <m>\Q</m> from <xref ref="prog_example-equiv"></xref> 
          is an equivalence relation.

          Let <m>A</m> be a nonempty set.

            <idx><h>relation</h><h>identity</h></idx>   
          is an equivalence relation.
          This relation is also called the
          <term>identity relation on <m>\boldsymbol{A}</m></term>
          and is denoted by  <m>I_A</m>, where
          <me>
            I_A  = \left\{ {\left( {x, x} \right)   \mid x \in A} \right\}\!

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Define the relation <m>\sim</m> on <m>\mathbb{R}</m> as follows:
          <blockquote>
            For <m>a, b \in \mathbb{R}</m>, <m>a \sim b</m> if and only if there 
            exists an integer <m>k</m> such that <m>a - b = 2k\pi</m>.
          </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
        We will prove that the relation <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.
        The relation  <m>\sim</m>  is reflexive on
        <m>\mathbb{R}</m> since for each  <m>a \in \mathbb{R}</m>,
        <m>a - a = 0 = 2 \cdot 0 \cdot \pi</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now, let  <m>a,
        b \in \mathbb{R}</m> and assume that  <m>a \sim b</m>.
        We will prove that  <m>b \sim a</m>.
        Since  <m>a \sim b</m>, there exists an integer  <m>k</m>  such that
        <me>
          a - b = 2k\pi
        </me>.
        By multiplying both sides of this equation by <m>-1</m>,
        we obtain
        <md>
          <mrow>( { - 1} )( {a - b} ) \amp = ( { - 1} )( {2k\pi } )</mrow>
          <mrow>b = a \amp = 2( { - k} )\pi</mrow>
        </md>.

        Since  <m>- k \in \mathbb{Z}</m>,
        the last equation proves that  <m>b \sim a</m>.
        Hence, we have proven that if  <m>a \sim b</m>,
        then  <m>b \sim a</m> and,
        therefore, the relation  <m>\sim</m>  is symmetric.
        </p>
        <p>
        To prove transitivity, let
        <m>a,
        b, c \in \mathbb{R}</m> and assume that  <m>a \sim b</m> and <m>b \sim c</m>.
        We will prove that  <m>a \sim c</m>.
        Now, there exist integers  <m>k</m>  and  <m>n</m>  such that
        <me>
          a - b = 2k\pi \text{  and  } b - c = 2n\pi
        </me>.
        By adding the corresponding sides of these two equations,
        we see that
        <md>
          <mrow>( {a - b} ) + ( {b - c} ) \amp = 2k\pi  + 2n\pi</mrow>
          <mrow>a - c \amp = 2( {k + n} )\pi</mrow>
        </md>

        By the closure properties of the integers,
        <m>k + n \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
        So this proves that <m>a \sim c</m> and,
        hence the relation  <m>\sim</m>  is transitive.
        </p>
        <p>
        We have now proven that  <m>\sim</m>  is an equivalence relation on  <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.
        This equivalence relation is important in trigonometry.
        If   <m>a \sim b</m>,
        then there exists an integer  <m>k</m>  such that  <m>a - b = 2k\pi</m> and,
        hence,  <m>a = b + k( {2\pi } )</m>.
        Since the sine and cosine functions are periodic with a period of  <m>2\pi</m>,
        we see that
        <md>
          <mrow>\sin a \amp = \sin( {b + k( {2\pi } )} ) = \sin b,\text{ and }</mrow>
          <mrow>\cos a \amp = \cos( {b + k( {2\pi } )} ) = \cos b</mrow>
        </md>.

        Therefore, when  <m>a \sim b</m>,
        each of the trigonometric functions have the same value at  <m>a</m>  and  <m>b</m>.

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For an example from Euclidean geometry,
          we define a relation <m>P</m> on the set
          <m>\mathcal{L}</m> of all lines in the plane as follows:
          <blockquote>
            For <m>l_1 , l_2 \in \mathcal{L}</m>, <m>l_1 \mathrel{P}l_2</m> if and only 
            if <m>l_1</m> is parallel to <m>l_2</m> or <m>l_1 = l_2</m>.
          </blockquote>
        
        We added the second condition to the definition of <m>P</m> to ensure that <m>P</m> 
        is reflexive on <m>\mathcal{L}</m>.
        Theorems from Euclidean geometry tell us that if <m>l_1</m> is parallel to <m>l_2</m>,
        then <m>l_2</m> is parallel to <m>l_1</m>,
        and if <m>l_1</m> is parallel to <m>l_2</m> and <m>l_2</m> is parallel to <m>l_3</m>,
        then <m>l_1</m> is parallel to <m>l_3</m>.
        (Drawing pictures will help visualize these properties.)
        This tells us that the relation <m>P</m> is reflexive,
        symmetric, and transitive and,
        hence, an equivalence relation on <m>\mathcal{L}</m>.

        <p>
          The relation <m>R</m> is not reflexive on <m>A</m> and is not symmetric. However, 
          it is transitive since the conditional statement
          <q>For all <m>x, y, z \in A</m>, if <m>x \mathrel{R} y</m> and <m>y \mathrel{R} z</m>, 
          then <m>x \mathrel{R} z</m></q>
          is a true conditional statement since the hypothesis will always be false.

        <p>
          There are many possible equivalence relations on this set. Perhaps one of the easier 
          ways to determine one is to first decide what elements will be equivalent. For example, 
          suppose we say that we want 1 and 2 to be equivalent (and of course, all elements will 
          be equivalent to themselves). So if we use the symbol <m>\sim</m> for the equivalence 
          relation, then we need <m>1 \sim 2</m> and <m>2 \sim 1</m>. Using set notation, we can 
          write this equivalence relation as
          <me>
           \{ (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (1, 2), (2, 1) \}

          The relation <m>R</m> is not reflexive on <m>A</m>. For example, 
          <m>\left( 4, 4 \right) \notin R</m>.
          The relation <m>R</m> is symmetric. If <m>\left( a, b \right) \in R</m>, then
          <m>\left| a \right| + \left| b \right| = 4</m>. Therefore, 
          <m>\left| b \right| + \left| a \right| = 4</m>, and hence, 
          <m>\left( b, a \right) \in R</m>.
          The relation <m>R</m> is not transitive. For example, <m>\left( 4, 0 \right) \in R</m>,

        <answer>
          <p>
            The relation <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation.
            For <m>a \in \mathbb{R}</m>, <m>a \sim a</m> since <m>f \left( a \right) 
            = f \left( a \right)</m>. So, <m>\sim</m> is reflexive.
            For <m>a, b \in \mathbb{R}</m>, if <m>a \sim b</m>, then <m>f \left( a \right) 
            = f \left( b \right)</m>. So,
            <m>f \left( b \right) = f \left( a \right)</m>. Hence, <m>b \sim a</m> and

            For <m>a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}</m>, if <m>a \sim b</m> and <m>b \sim c</m>, then

            = f \left( c \right)</m>. So,

        <answer>
          <p>
            The relation <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>\Z</m>. It is reflexive 
            since for each integer <m>a</m>, <m>a + a = 2a</m> and hence, <m>2</m> divides 
            <m>a + a</m>. Now let <m>a, b \in \Z</m> and assume that 2 divides <m>a + b</m>. 
            Since <m>a + b = b + a</m>, 2 divides <m>b + a</m> and hence, <m>\sim</m> is symmetric. 
            Finally, let <m>a, b, c \in \Z</m> and assume that
            <m>a \sim b</m> and <m>b \sim c</m>. Since 2 divides <m>a + b</m>, <m>a</m> and 
            <m>b</m> must both be odd or both be even. In the case that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> 
            are both odd, then <m>b \sim c</m> implies that <m>c</m> must be odd. Hence, 
            <m>a + c</m> is even and <m>a \sim c</m>. A similar proof shows that if <m>a</m> and 
            <m>b</m> are both even, then <m>a \sim c</m>. Therefore, <m>\sim</m> is transitive.

                Assume <m>a \sim a</m>.
                Then <m>\left( a + 2a \right) \equiv 0 \pmod 3</m> since

              <p>
                <m>\left( 3a \right) \equiv 0 \pmod 3</m>.
                Therefore, <m>\sim</m> is reflexive on <m>\Z</m>.
                In addition, if <m>a \sim b</m>,
                then <m>\left( a + 2b \right) \equiv 0 \pmod 3</m>,
                and if we multiply both sides of this congruence by 2, we get
                <md>
                  <mrow>2\left( a + 2b \right) \amp \equiv 2 \cdot 0 \pmod 3</mrow>
                  <mrow>\left( 2a + 4b \right) \amp \equiv 0 \pmod 3</mrow>
                  <mrow>\left( 2a + b \right) \amp \equiv 0 \pmod 3</mrow>

                </md>.
              </p>
              <p>
                This means that <m>b \sim a</m> and hence, <m>\sim</m> is symmetric.
              </p>
              <p>
                We now assume that <m>\left( a + 2b \right) \equiv 0\pmod 3</m> and 
                <m>\left( b + 2c \right) \equiv 0\pmod 3</m>.
                By adding the corresponding sides of these two congruences,
                we obtain
                <md>
                  <mrow>\left( a + 2b \right) + \left( b + 2c \right) \amp \equiv 0 + 0 \pmod 3</mrow>
                  <mrow>\left( a + 3b + 2c \right) \amp \equiv 0 \pmod 3</mrow>
                  <mrow>\left( a + 2c \right) \amp \equiv 0 \pmod 3</mrow>

              </p>
              <p>
                Hence, the relation <m>\sim</m> is transitive and we have proved that

      <introduction>

          In this section,
          we focused on the properties of a relation that are part of the definition of an 
          equivalence relation.
          However, there are other properties of relations that are of importance.
          We will study two of these properties in this activity.
