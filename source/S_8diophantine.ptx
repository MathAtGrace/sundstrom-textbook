      In the two beginning activities,
      we were interested only in integer solutions for certain equations.
      In such instances, we give the equation a special name.

    <definition xml:id="diophantineequation">
      <statement>
        <p>
          An equation whose solutions are required to be integers is called a
          <term>Diophantine equation</term>.

      Diophantine equations are named in honor of the Greek mathematician Diophantus of 
      Alexandria <idx><h>Diophantus of Alexandria</h></idx>
      (third century <abbr>C.E.</abbr>).
      Very little is known about Diophantus' life except that he probably lived in 
      Alexandria in the early part of the fourth century <abbr>C.E.</abbr> and was probably the 
      first to use letters for unknown quantities in arithmetic problems.
      His most famous work, <pubtitle>Arithmetica</pubtitle>,
      consists of approximately 130 problems and their solutions.
      Most of these problems involved solutions of equations in various numbers of variables.
      It is interesting to note that Diophantus did not restrict his solutions to the integers 
      but recognized rational number solutions as well.
      Today, however,
      the solutions for a so-called Diophantine equation must be integers.

      The equations that were investigated in <xref ref="exploringlinear">Beginning Activity 2</xref>
      were linear Diophantine equations in two variables.
      The problem of determining all the solutions of a linear Diophantine equation has been 
      completely solved.
      Before stating the general result,
      we will provide a few more examples.

        <p>
          It would be nice to determine the pattern that these solutions exhibit.
          If we consider the solution <m>x = 2</m> and <m>y =-1</m> to be the
          <q>starting point,</q>
          then we can see that the other solutions are obtained by adding 3 to <m>x</m> and 
          subtracting 4 from <m>y</m> in the previous solution.
          So we can write these solutions to the equation as
          <me>
            x = 2 + 3k \qquad \text{ and }  \qquad y = -1 - 4k
          </me>,
          where <m>k</m> is an integer.
          We can use substitution and algebra to verify that these expressions for <m>x</m> 
          and <m>y</m> give solutions of this equation as follows:
          <md>
            <mrow>4x + 3y \amp = 4 \left( 2+3k \right) + 3 \left( -1-4k \right)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \left( 8 + 12k \right) + \left( -3 - 12k \right)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 5</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We should note that we have not yet proved that these solutions are all of the 
          solutions of the Diophantine equation <m>4x + 3y = 5</m>.
          This will be done later.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the general form for a linear Diophantine equation is <m>ax + by = c</m>,
          then for this example, <m>a = 4</m> and <m>b = 3</m>.
          Notice that for this equation,
          we started with one solution and obtained other solutions by adding <m>b = 3</m> to 
          <m>x</m> and subtracting <m>a = 4</m> from <m>y</m> in the previous solution.
          Also, notice that <m>\gcd( 3, 4 ) = 1</m>.

          One of the Diophantine equations in <xref ref="exploringlinear">Beginning Activity 2</xref> 
          was <m>3x + 5y = 11</m>.
          We were able to write the solutions of this Diophantine equation in the form
          <me>
            x = 2 + 5k  \text{ and }   y = 1 - 3k
          </me>,
          where <m>k</m> is an integer.
          Notice that <m>x = 2</m> and <m>y = 1</m> is a solution of this equation.
          If we consider this equation to be in the form <m>ax + by = c</m>,
          then we see that <m>a = 3</m>,
          <m>b = 5</m>, and <m>c = 11</m>.
          Solutions for this equation can be written in the form
          <me>
            x = 2 + bk  \text{ and }   y = 1 - ak
          </me>,
          where <m>k</m> is an integer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other equation was <m>4x + 6y = 16</m>.
          So in this case, <m>a = 4</m>,
          <m>b = 6</m>, and <m>c = 16</m>.
          Also notice that <m>d = \gcd ( 4, 6 ) = 2</m>.
          We note that <m>x = 4</m> and <m>y = 0</m> is one solution of this Diophantine 
          equation and solutions can be written in the form
          <me>
            x = 4 + 3k  \text{ and }   y = 0 - 2k
          </me>,
          where <m>k</m> is an integer.
          Using the values of <m>a</m>,
          <m>b</m>, and <m>d</m> given above,
          we see that the solutions can be written in the form

            x = 2 + \frac{b}{d} k  \text{ and }   y = 0 - \frac{a}{d}

            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    
    <proof>
      <p>
        The proof of <xref ref="T_lindiop2-1"/> is <xref ref="exer_lindioph2"/>.
        For <xref ref="T_lindiop2-2"/>, we let <m>a</m>,
        <m>b</m>,
        and <m>c</m> be integers with <m>a \ne 0</m> and <m>b \ne 0</m>,
        and let <m>d = \gcd( a,b )</m>.
        We also assume that <m>d \mid c</m>.
        Since <m>d = \gcd( a,b )</m>,
        <xref ref="T_gcdaslincomb"></xref>
        tells us that <m>d</m> is a linear combination of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
        So there exist integers <m>s</m> and <m>t</m> such that
        <men xml:id="eq_lindioph1">
          d = as + bt
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>d \mid c</m>,
        there exists an integer <m>m</m> such that <m>c = dm</m>.
        We can now multiply both sides of equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_lindioph1"/> by <m>m</m> 
        and obtain
        <md>
          <mrow>dm \amp = ( {as + bt} ) m</mrow>
          <mrow>c \amp a( sm ) + b( tm )</mrow>
        </md>.

        This means that <m>x = sm</m>,
        <m>y = tm</m> is a solution of <m>ax + by = c</m>,
        and we have proved that the Diophantine equation
        <m>ax + by = c</m> has at least one solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let <m>x = x_0</m>,
        <m>y = y_0</m> be any particular solution of <m>ax + by = c</m>,
        let <m>k \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, and let
        <men xml:id="eq_x0andy0">
          x = x_0 + \frac{b}{d} k  \qquad  y = y_0 - \frac{a}{d} k
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We now verify that for each <m>k \in \mathbb{Z}</m>,
        the equations in<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_x0andy0"/> produce a solution of <m>ax + by = c</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>ax + by \amp = a \!\left( {x_0 + \frac{b}{d} k } \right) + b 
          \!\left( {y_0 - \frac{a}{d} k} \right )</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = a x_0 + \frac{ab}{d} k + b y_0 - \frac{ab}{d} k</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = a x_0 + b y_0</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = c</mrow>
        </md>.

        This proves that the Diophantine equation
        <m>ax + by = c</m> has infinitely many solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We now show that every solution of this equation can be written in the form described 
        in <xref ref="eq_x0andy0"/>.
        So suppose that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are integers such that <m>ax + by = c</m>.
        Then
        <me>
          ( {ax + by} ) - ( {ax_0 + by_0} ) = c - c = 0
        </me>,
        and this equation can be rewritten in the following form:
        <men xml:id="eq_dioph3">
          a( {x - x_0} ) = b( {y_0 - y} )
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dividing both sides of this equation by <m>d</m>, we obtain
        <me>
          \left( \frac{a}{d} \right) \left( {x - x_0} \right ) = \left( \frac{b}{d} \right) 
          \left( {y_0 - y} \right)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This implies that
        <me>
          \frac{a}{d} \text{ divides }  \left( \frac{b}{d} \right) ( {y_0 - y} )
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, by <xref ref="exer_dividebygcd"/> in <xref ref="S_primefactorizations"></xref>,
        <m>\gcd \!\left( \dfrac{a}{d}, \dfrac{b}{d} \right) = 1</m>,
        and so by <xref ref="T_relativelyprimeprop"></xref>,
        we can conclude that <m>\dfrac{a}{d}</m> divides <m>\left( {y_0 - y} \right)</m>.
        This means that there exists an integer <m>k</m> such that <m>y_0 - y = \dfrac{a}{d} k</m>,
        and solving for <m>y</m> gives
        <me>
          y = y_0 - \frac{a}{d} k
        </me>.

        Substituting this value for <m>y</m> in <xref ref="eq_dioph3">equation</xref> and solving 
        for <m>x</m> yields
        <me>
          x = x_0 + \frac{b}{d} k
        </me>.

        This proves that every solution of the Diophantine equation
        <m>ax + by = c</m> can be written in the form prescribed in <xref ref="eq_x0andy0"/>.

          <solution>
            <p>
              Since 21 does not divide 40,
              <xref ref="T_lindioph2"></xref>
              tells us that the Diophantine equation <m>63x + 336y = 40</m> has no solutions.
              Remember that this means there is no ordered pair of integers
              <m>( x, y )</m> such that <m>63x + 336y = 40</m>.
              However, if we allow <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> to be real numbers,
              then there are real number solutions.
              In fact, we can graph the straight line whose equation is
              <m>63x + 336y = 40</m> in the Cartesian plane.
              From the fact that there is no pair of integers

              y</m> such that <m>63x + 336y = 40</m>,
              we can conclude that there is no point on the graph of this line in which both

            Use the Euclidean Algorithm to verify that <m>\gcd( {144, 225} ) = 9</m>.
            What conclusion can be made about linear Diophantine equation
            <m>144x + 225y = 27</m> using <xref ref="T_lindioph2"></xref>?
            If this Diophantine equation has solutions,
            write formulas that will generate the solutions.
          </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              To write formulas that will generate all the solutions,
              we first need to find one solution for <m>144x + 225y = 27</m>.
              This can sometimes be done by trial and error,
              but there is a systematic way to find a solution.
              The first step is to use the Euclidean Algorithm in reverse to write
              <m>\gcd ( {144, 225} )</m> as a linear combination of 144 and 225.
              See <xref ref="S_gcd"></xref> to review how to do this.
              The result from using the Euclidean Algorithm in reverse for this situation is
              <me>
                144 \cdot 11 + 225 \cdot ( {-7} ) = 9
              </me>.
              If we multiply both sides of this equation by 3, we obtain
              <me>
                144 \cdot 33 + 225 \cdot ( {-21} ) = 27
              </me>.
              This means that <m>x_0 = 33,
              y_0 = -21</m> is a solution of the linear Diophantine equation <m>144x + 225y = 27</m>.
              We can now use <xref ref="T_lindioph2"></xref>
              to conclude that all solutions of this Diophantine equation can be written in the form
              <me>
                x = 33 + \frac{225}{9} k \qquad y = -21 -\frac{144}{9} k
              </me>,
              where <m>k \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
              Simplifying,
              we see that all solutions can be written in the form
              <me>
                x = 33 + 25 k \qquad y = -21 -16 k
              </me>,

            <p>
              We can check this general solution as

          b \in \mathbb{Z}</m> with <m>a \ne 0</m>.
          A congruence of the form <m>ax \equiv b \pmod n</m> is called a
          <term>linear congruence in one variable</term>.
            <idx><h>linear congruence</h></idx>
          This is called a linear congruence since the variable <m>x</m> occurs to the first power.

            A <term>solution of a linear congruence in one variable</term>
            is defined similarly to the solution of an equation.
            A solution is an integer that makes the resulting congruence true when the integer
