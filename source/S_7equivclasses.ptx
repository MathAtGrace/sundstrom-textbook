      <title>Beginning Activity 1: Sets Associated with a Relation</title>
      <p>
        As was indicated in <xref ref="S_equivrelations"></xref>,
        an equivalence relation on a set <m>A</m> is a relation with a certain combination of 
        properties (reflexive,
        symmetric,
        and transitive) that allow us to sort the elements of the set into certain classes.
        This is done by means of certain subsets of <m>A</m> that are associated with the e
        lements of the set <m>A</m>.
        This will be illustrated with the following example.
        Let <m>A = \left\{ {a, b, c, d, e} \right\}</m>,
        and let <m>R</m> be the relation on the set <m>A</m> defined as follows:
        <md>
          <mrow>a \amp \mathrel{R} a  \amp b \amp \mathrel{R} b  \amp c \amp \mathrel{R} c  \amp d \amp \mathrel{R} d   \amp e \amp \mathrel{R} e</mrow>
          <mrow>a \amp \mathrel{R} b  \amp b \amp \mathrel{R} a  \amp b \amp \mathrel{R} e  \amp e \amp \mathrel{R} b</mrow>
          <mrow>a \amp \mathrel{R} e  \amp e \amp \mathrel{R} a  \amp c \amp \mathrel{R} d  \amp d \amp \mathrel{R} c</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        For each <m>y \in A</m>,
        define the subset <m>R[y]</m> of <m>A</m> as follows:
        <me>
          R[y] = \left\{ x \in A \mid x \mathrel{R} y \right\}
        </me>.
 
        That is, <m>R[y]</m> consists of those elements in <m>A</m> such that <m>x \mathrel{R} y</m>.
        For example, using <m>y = a</m>,
        we see that <m>a \mathrel{R} a</m>, <m>b \mathrel{R} a</m>,
        and <m>e \mathrel{R} a</m>, and so <m>R[a] = \{ a, b, e \}</m>.

        As we will see in this section,
        the relationships between these sets are typical for an equivalence relation.
        The following example will show how different this can be for a relation that is not 
        an equivalence relation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>A = \left\{ {a, b, c, d, e} \right\}</m>,
        and let <m>S</m> be the relation on the set <m>A</m> defined as follows:
        <md>
          <mrow>b \amp \mathrel{S} b  \amp c \amp \mathrel{S} c  \amp d \amp \mathrel{S} d   \amp e \amp \mathrel{S} e</mrow>

        <exercise>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Draw a digraph that represents the relation <m>S</m> on <m>A</m>.
              Explain why <m>S</m> is not an equivalence relation on <m>A</m>.

      <p>
        For each <m>y \in A</m>,
        define the subset <m>S[y]</m> of <m>A</m> as follows:
        <me>
          S[ y ] = \left\{ { {x \in A } \mid x \mathrel{S} y} \right\} = \left\{ { {x \in A } 
          \mid \left( {x, y} \right) \in S} \right\}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, using <m>y = b</m>,
        we see that <m>S[b] = \{ a, b \}</m> since
        <m>(a, b) \in S</m> and <m>(b, b) \in S</m>.
        In addition,
        we see that <m>S[a] = \emptyset</m> since there is no <m>x \in A</m> such that

      <title>Beginning Activity 2: Congruence Modulo 3</title>
      <p>
        An important equivalence relation that we have studied is congruence modulo <m>n</m> 
        on the integers.
        We can also define subsets of the integers based on congruence modulo <m>n</m>.
        We will illustrate this with congruence modulo 3.
        For example,
        we can define <m>C[0]</m> to be the set of all integers <m>a</m> that are congruent to 
        0 modulo 3.
        That is,
        <me>
          C[ 0 ] = \left\{ { {a \in \mathbb{Z} } \mid a \equiv 0 \pmod 3} \right\}\!
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since an integer <m>a</m> is congruent to 0 modulo 3 if and only if 3 divides <m>a</m>,
        we can use the roster method to specify this set as follows:
        <me>
          C[0] = \left\{  \ldots, -9, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, 9, \ldots \right\}

  <subsection>
    <title>The Definition of an Equivalence Class</title>
   
    <p>
      We have indicated that an equivalence relation on a set is a relation with a certain 
      combination of properties (reflexive,
      symmetric,
      and transitive) that allow us to sort the elements of the set into certain classes.
      We saw this happen in the beginning  activities.
      We can now illustrate specifically what this means.
      For example,
      in <xref text="custom" ref="PA_congruencemodulo3">Beginning Activity 2</xref>,
      we used the equivalence relation of congruence modulo 3 on
      <m>\mathbb{Z}</m> to construct the following three sets:
      <md>
        <mrow>C[ 0 ] \amp = \left\{ { {a \in \mathbb{Z} } \mid a \equiv 0 \pmod 3} \right\}\!,</mrow>
        <mrow>C[ 1 ] \amp = \left\{ { {a \in \mathbb{Z} } \mid a \equiv 1 \pmod 3} \right\}\!,\text{ and }</mrow>
        <mrow>C[ 2 ] \amp = \left\{ { {a \in \mathbb{Z} } \mid a \equiv 2 \pmod 3} \right\}\!</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main results that we want to use now are <xref ref="T_congtorem"></xref>
      and <xref ref="C_congtorem"></xref>.
      This corollary tells us that for any <m>a \in \mathbb{Z}</m>,
      <m>a</m> is congruent to precisely one of the integers 0, 1, or 2.
      Consequently,
      the integer <m>a</m> must be congruent to 0, 1, or 2, and it cannot be congruent to two of these numbers.
      Thus
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            For each <m>a \in \mathbb{Z}</m>,
            <m>a \in C[ 0 ]</m>, <m>a \in C[ 1 ]</m>,
            or <m>a \in C[ 2 ]</m>; and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>C[ 0 ] \cap C[ 1 ] = \emptyset</m>,
            <m>C[ 0 ] \cap C[ 2 ] = \emptyset</m> , and <m>C[ 1 ] \cap C[ 2 ] = \emptyset</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that the relation of congruence modulo 3 sorts the integers into three 
      distinct sets,
      or classes,
      and that each pair of these sets have no elements in common.
      So if we use a rectangle to represent <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>,
      we can divide that rectangle into three smaller rectangles,
      corresponding to <m>C[ 0 ]</m>, <m>C[ 1 ]</m>,
      and <m>C[ 2 ]</m>, and we might picture this situation as follows:
    </p>
    <tabular>
      <row bottom="medium" header="yes">
        <cell></cell>
        <cell>The Integers</cell>
        <cell></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        
        <cell right="medium"><line><m>C[ 0 ]</m> consisting</line>
        <line> of all integers with a </line>
        <line>remainder of 0 when</line> <line>divided by 3</line></cell>
        <cell right="medium"><line><m>C[ 1 ]</m> consisting</line>
        <line> of all integers with a </line>
        <line>remainder of 1 when</line> <line>divided by 3</line></cell>
        <cell><line><m>C[ 2 ]</m> consisting</line>
        <line> of all integers with a </line>
        <line>remainder of 2 when</line> <line>divided by 3</line></cell>

      </row>
    </tabular>

    <p>
      Each integer is in exactly one of the three sets <m>C[ 0 ]</m>,
      <m>C[ 1 ]</m>, or <m>C[ 2 ]</m>,
      and two integers are congruent modulo 3 if and only if they are in the same set.
      We will see that, in a similar manner,
      if <m>n</m> is any natural number,
      then the relation of congruence modulo <m>n</m> can be used to sort the integers into <m>n</m> classes.
      We will also see that in general,
      if we have an equivalence relation <m>R</m> on a set <m>A</m>,
      we can sort the elements of the set <m>A</m> into classes in a similar manner.

            We use the notation <m>[ a ]</m> when only one equivalence relation is being used.
            If there is more than one equivalence relation,
            then we need to distinguish between the equivalence classes for each relation.
            We often use something like <m>[ a ]_{ \sim}</m>,
            or if <m>R</m> is the name of the relation,
            we can use <m>R[ a ]</m> or <m>[a]_R</m> for the equivalence class of <m>a</m> 
            determined by <m>R</m>.
            In any case,
            always remember that when we are working with any equivalence relation on a set 
            <m>A</m> if <m>a \in A</m>,

    <title>Congruence Modulo <m>\boldsymbol{n}</m> and Congruence Classes</title>
    <p>
      In <xref text="custom" ref="PA_congruencemodulo3">Beginning Activity 2</xref>,
      we used the notation <m>C[ k ]</m> for the set of all integers that are congruent to 
      <m>k</m> modulo 3.
      We could have used a similar notation for equivalence classes,
      and this would have been perfectly acceptable.
      However, the notation <m>[ a ]</m> is probably the most common notation for the 
      equivalence class of <m>a</m>.
      We will now use this same notation when dealing with congruence modulo <m>n</m> 
      when only one congruence relation is under consideration.

      We have seen that congruence modulo 3 divides the integers into three distinct 
      congruence classes.
      Each congruence class consists of those integers with the same remainder when divided by 3.
      In a similar manner,
      if we use congruence modulo 2, we simply divide the integers into two classes.
      One class will consist of all the integers that have a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, 
      and the other class will consist of all the integers that have a remainder of 1 when 
      divided by 2.
      That is, congruence modulo 2 simply divides the integers into the even and odd integers.

    <title>Properties of Equivalence Classes</title>
    <p>
      As we have seen,
      in <xref text="custom" ref="PA_setswithrelation">Beginning Activity 1</xref>,
      the relation <m>R</m> was an equivalence relation.
      For that activity,
      we used <m>R[ y ]</m> to denote the equivalence class of <m>y \in A</m>,
      and we observed that these equivalence classes were either equal or disjoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, in <xref text="custom" ref="PA_setswithrelation">Beginning Activity 1</xref>,
      the relation <m>S</m> was not an equivalence relation,
      and hence we do not use the term
      <q>equivalence class</q>
      for this relation.
      We should note, however,
      that the sets <m>S[ y ]</m> were not equal and were not disjoint.
      This exhibits one of the main distinctions between equivalence relations and relations 
      that are not equivalence relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="T_propsofequivclasses"></xref>,
      we will prove that if <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation on the set <m>A</m>,
      then we can
      <q>sort</q>
      the elements of <m>A</m> into distinct equivalence classes.
      The properties of equivalence classes that we will prove are as follows:
        <idx><h>equivalence class</h><h>properties of</h></idx>
      (1) Every element of 
      <m>A</m> is in its own equivalence class; 
      (2) two elements are equivalent if and only if their equivalence classes are equal;
      and (3) two equivalence classes are either identical or they are disjoint.

    <theorem xml:id="T_propsofequivclasses">

          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a nonempty set and assume that <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation 
        on <m>A</m>.
        To prove the first part of the theorem, let <m>a \in A</m>.
        Since <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>A</m>,
        it is reflexive on <m>A</m>.
        Thus, <m>a \sim a</m>, and we can conclude that <m>a \in [ a ]</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second part of this theorem is a biconditional statement.
        We will prove it by proving two conditional statements.
        We will first prove that if <m>a \sim b</m>,
        then <m>[ a ] = [ b ]</m>.
        So let <m>a, b \in A</m> and assume that <m>a \sim b</m>.
        We will now prove that the two sets <m>[ a ]</m> and <m>[ b ]</m> are equal.
        We will do this by proving that each is a subset of the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, assume that <m>x \in [ a ]</m>.
        Then, by definition, <m>x \sim a</m>.
        Since we have assumed that <m>a \sim b</m>,
        we can use the transitive property of <m>\sim</m> to conclude that <m>x \sim b</m>,
        and this means that <m>x \in [ b ]</m>.
        This proves that <m>[ a ] \subseteq [ b ]</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We now assume that <m>y \in [ b ]</m>.
        This means that <m>y \sim b</m>,
        and hence by the symmetric property, that <m>b \sim y</m>.
        Again, we are assuming that <m>a \sim b</m>.
        So we have <m>a \sim b</m> and <m>b \sim y</m>.
        We use the transitive property to conclude that <m>a \sim y</m> and then,
        using the symmetric property,
        we conclude that <m>y \sim a</m>.
        This proves that <m>y \in [ a ]</m> and, hence,
        that <m>[ b ] \subseteq [ a ]</m>.
        This means that we can conclude that if <m>a \sim b</m>,
        then <m>[ a ] = [ b ]</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We must now prove that if <m>[ a ] = [ b ]</m>, then <m>a \sim b</m>.
        Let <m>a, b \in A</m> and assume that <m>[ a ] = [ b ]</m>.
        Using the first part of the theorem,
        we know that <m>a \in [ a ]</m> and since the two sets are equal,
        this tells us that <m>a \in [ b ]</m>.
        Hence by the definition of <m>[ b ]</m>,
        we conclude that <m>a \sim b</m>.
        This completes the proof of the second part of the theorem.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the third part of the theorem, let <m>a, b \in A</m>.
        Since this part of the theorem is a disjunction,
        we will consider two cases: Either
        <me>
          [ a ] \cap [ b ] = \emptyset   \text{ or } [ a ] \cap [ b ] \ne \emptyset
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case where <m>[ a ] \cap [ b ] = \emptyset</m>,
        the first part of the disjunction is true,
        and hence there is nothing to prove.
        So we assume that <m>[ a ] \cap [ b ] \ne \emptyset</m> and will show that 
        <m>[ a ] = [ b ]</m>.
        Since <m>[ a ] \cap [ b ] \ne \emptyset</m>,
        there is an element <m>x</m> in <m>A</m> such that
        <me>
          x \in [ a ] \cap [ b ]
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that <m>x \in [ a ]</m> and <m>x \in [ b ]</m>.
        Consequently, <m>x \sim a</m> and <m>x \sim b</m>,
        and so we can use the second part of the theorem to conclude that
        <m>[ x ] = [ a ]</m> and <m>[ x ] = [ b ]</m>.
        Hence, <m>[ a ] = [ b ]</m>,
        and we have proven that <m>[ a ] = [ b ]</m> or <m>[ a ] \cap [ b ] = \emptyset</m>. 
      </p>
    </proof>

      A partition of a set <m>A</m> is a collection of subsets of <m>A</m> that
      <q>breaks up</q>
      the set <m>A</m> into disjoint subsets.
      Technically,
      each pair of distinct subsets in the collection must be disjoint.
      We then say that the collection of subsets is
      <term>pairwise disjoint</term>.
          <idx><h>pairwise disjoint</h></idx>
          <idx><h>disjoint</h><h>pairwise</h></idx>

    <p>
      There is a close relation between partitions and equivalence classes since the 
      equivalence classes of an equivalence relation form a partition of the underlying set,
      as will be proven in <xref ref="T_equivclasses-partition"></xref>.
      The proof of this theorem relies on the results in <xref ref="T_propsofequivclasses"></xref>.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="T_equivclasses-partition">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\sim</m> be an equivalence relation on the nonempty set <m>A</m>.
          Then the collection <m>\mathcal{C}</m> of all equivalence classes determined by 
          <m>\sim</m> is a partition of the set <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>\sim</m> be an equivalence relation on the nonempty set <m>A</m>,
        and let <m>\mathcal{C}</m> be the collection of all equivalence classes determined by <m>\sim</m>.
        That is,
        <me>
          \mathcal{C} = \left\{ { {[ a ]} \mid a \in A} \right\}\!
        </me>.

        We will use <xref ref="T_propsofequivclasses"></xref>
        to prove that <m>\mathcal{C}</m> is a partition of <m>A</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <xref ref="T_propsofequivclasses1"/> of <xref ref="T_propsofequivclasses"></xref>
        states that for each <m>a \in A</m>, <m>a \in [ a ]</m>.
        In terms of the equivalence classes,
        this means that each equivalence class is nonempty since each element of <m>A</m> 
        is in its own equivalence class.
        Consequently, <m>\mathcal{C}</m>,
        the collection of all equivalence classes determined by <m>\sim</m>,
        satisfies the first two conditions of the definition of a partition.
      </p>
      <p>
        We must now show that the collection
        <m>\mathcal{C}</m> of all equivalence classes determined by <m>\sim</m> satisfies the 
        third condition for being a partition.
        That is, we need to show that any two equivalence classes are either equal or are disjoint.
        However, this is exactly the result in <xref ref="T_propsofequivclasses3"/> of 
        <xref ref="T_propsofequivclasses"></xref>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, we have proven that the collection
        <m>\mathcal{C}</m> of all equivalence classes determined by <m>\sim</m> is a partition 
        of the set <m>A</m>. 
      </p>
    </proof>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Note: <xref ref="T_equivclasses-partition"></xref>
      has shown us that if <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation on a nonempty set <m>A</m>,
      then the collection of the equivalence classes determined by <m>\sim</m> form a 
      partition of the set <m>A</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This process can be reversed.
      This means that given a partition
      <m>\mathcal{C}</m> of a nonempty set <m>A</m>,
      we can define an equivalence relation on <m>A</m> whose equivalence classes are precisely 
      the subsets of <m>A</m> that form the partition.
      This will be explored in <xref ref="exer_partition-equivrelation"/>.

      <answer>
        <p>
          Let <m>x \in A</m>. Since <m>x</m> has the same number of digits as itself, the

          If <m>x \mathrel{R} y</m>, then <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> have the same number of digits.  
          Hence, <m>y</m> and <m>x</m> have the same number of digits and <m>y \mathrel{R} x</m>, 
          and so <m>\mathrel{R}</m> is symmetric.

        <p>
          If <m>x \mathrel{R} y</m> and <m>y \mathrel{R} z</m>,then <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>  
          have the same number of digits and

          have the same number of digits, and so <m>x \mathrel{R} z</m>.

        <answer>
          <p>
            Let <m>a, b, c \in \Z_9</m>. Since <m>a^2 \equiv a^2 \pmod 9</m>, we see that 
            <m>a \sim a</m> and <m>\sim</m> is reflexive. Let <m>a, b, c \in \Z_9</m>. 
            If <m>a \sim b</m>, then <m>a^2 \equiv b^2 \pmod 9</m> and hence, by the symmetric 
            property of congruence, <m>b^2 \equiv a^2 \pmod 9</m>. This proves that <m>\sim</m> 
            is symmetric.  Finally, if <m>a \sim b</m> and <m>b \sim c</m>, then
            <m>a^2 \equiv b^2 \pmod 9</m> and <m>b^2 \equiv c^2 \pmod 9</m>. By the transitive

          That is, <m>A = \left\{ { {\left( {a, b} \right) \in \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} } \mid b \ne 0} \right\}</m>.
          Define the relation <m>\approx</m> on <m>A</m> as follows:
          <blockquote>
            For <m>\left( {a, b} \right), \left( {c, d} \right) \in A</m>, 
            <m>\left( {a, b} \right) \approx \left( {c, d} \right)</m> if and only if <m>ad = bc</m>.

        <answer>

            To prove the relation is symmetric, note that if <m>(a, b) \approx (c, d)</m>, then
            <m>ad = bc</m>. This implies that <m>cb = da</m> and, hence,
