      <title>Comparison with Other Versions</title>
        
      <p>
        This textbook is an adaptation of 
        <pubtitle><url href="https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/books/24/" visual="scholarworks.gvsu.edu/books/24/">Mathematical Reasoning: Writing and Proof, <pubtitle>Version 3</pubtitle></url></pubtitle>. 
        Please note that <pubtitle>Version 3</pubtitle> is the authoritative edition of <pubtitle>Mathematical Reasoning: 
        Writing and Proof</pubtitle>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <pubtitle><pretext /> Edition</pubtitle> is largely identical to 
        <pubtitle>Version 3</pubtitle>, with the following major exceptions:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Numbering of figures, tables, and other elements

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Many tables, figures, propositions, and other items in this edition have a 
                    different number than they do in <pubtitle>Version 3</pubtitle>. For example, Table 5.1 in <pubtitle>Version 3</pubtitle> 
                    appears as Table 5.11 in the <pubtitle><pretext /> Edition</pubtitle>.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    The only difference is the numbering. The items appear in the same order, 
                    with the same content, for both editions.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Chapter and section numbers are not changed, nor are exercise numbers.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Equation numbering

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    In the <pubtitle><pretext /> Edition</pubtitle>, all equations are numbered consecutively throughout the 
                    entire book. In contrast, equations in <pubtitle>Version 3</pubtitle> are numbered within each new 
                    theorem, proof, or activity.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    For example, Beginning Activity 2 of Section 3.3 includes an equation. It is the 
                    first equation in that activity, but the fourth listed in the book. This equation 
                    is numbered (4) in the <pubtitle><pretext /> Edition</pubtitle> and (1) in <pubtitle>Version 3</pubtitle>.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Hints and Answers

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    In print and PDF copies of <pubtitle>Version 3</pubtitle>, exercises with a hint or answer are 
                    indicated by an asterisk. 
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    In PDF copies of the <pubtitle><pretext /> Edition</pubtitle>, exercises with a hint or answer are 
                    indicated by an [h] or [a], respectively.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    In the web version of this edition, the hint or answer can be revealed directly 
                    below the exercise.

    <title>About This Edition</title>
    
    <p>
      <pubtitle>Mathematical Reasoning: Writing and Proof (<pretext /> Edition)</pubtitle> was developed as part of the 
      <url href="https://www.gvsu.edu/library/sc/AcceleratingOER" visual="gvsu.edu/library/sc/AcceleratingOER">Accelerating Open Educational Resources Initiative at Grand Valley State University</url>, with 
      support from the University Libraries and the President's Innovation Fund. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathematical Reasoning: Writing and Proof was written by Ted Sundstrom, Professor Emeritus of 
      Mathematics at Grand Valley State University. This textbook was converted into PreTeXt by Ian 
      Curtis, Editorial Assistant for the GVSU Libraries, with expert guidance and support from Oscar 
      Levin, Associate Professor, School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Northern Colorado, 
      and David Farmer, American Institute of Mathematics.

      Writing and Proof, Version 3</pubtitle>, written by Ted Sundstrom and adapted for PreTeXt by Ian Curtis. 
      Both editions are published by the Grand Valley State University Libraries. Previous versions of

    <title>Accessibility Statement</title>
    
    <p>
      The Grand Valley State University Libraries strive to ensure our tools, devices, services, and 
      environments are available to and usable by as many people as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The web version of <pubtitle>Mathematical Reasoning: Writing and Proof (<pretext /> Edition)</pubtitle> incorporates the 
      following features to support accessibility:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            All content can be navigated by use of a keyboard
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Links, headings, and tables have been designed to work with screen readers
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Many figures and images are described in alt text. Note that some figures are explained 
            fully in the corresponding text.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Mathematics in PreTeXt are rendered with MathJax so they can be understood by using 
            screen readers and/or other assistive devices.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      We have identified some accessibility issues which were beyond the GVSU Libraries' capacity to 
      address in the course of this adaptation. These present an opportunity for future adaptation or 
      revision by educators with expertise in mathematics pedagogy. Known accessibility issues include:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Some exercises and activities in this text require students to visually interpret diagrams 
            or figures; for example, Venn Diagrams (<xref ref="C_5settheory"/>) and Arrow diagrams (<xref ref="C_7equivrelations"/>). 
            These activities cannot be made accessible through alt text alone, and may need to be 
            redesigned or replaced. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Some images in this text have alt text which may be insufficient to communicate the 
            relevant concepts. The existing alt text would benefit greatly from expert review.  
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
