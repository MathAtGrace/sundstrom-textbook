      <title>Beginning Activity 1: Introduction to Infinite Sets</title>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="S_finitesets"></xref>,
        we defined a <term>finite set</term>
            <idx><h>finite set</h></idx>
        to be the empty set or a set <m>A</m> such that
        <m>A \approx \mathbb{N}_k</m> for some natural number <m>k</m>.
        We also defined an <term>infinite set</term>
            <idx><h>infinite set</h></idx>
        to be a set that is not finite, but the question now is,
        <q>How do we know if a set is infinite?</q>
        One way to determine if a set is an infinite set is to use 
        <xref ref="C_propersubsets"></xref>,
        which states that a finite set is not equivalent to any of its subsets.
        We can write this as a conditional statement as follows:
        <blockquote>
          If <m>A</m> is a finite set, then <m>A</m> is not equivalent to any of its proper subsets.
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>
        or more formally as
        <blockquote>
          For each set <m>A</m>, if <m>A</m> is a finite set, then for each proper subset 
          <m>B</m> of <m>A</m>, <m>A \not\approx B</m>.
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Write the contrapositive of the preceding conditional statement.
            Then explain how this statement can be used to determine if a set is infinite.

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we will describe several infinite sets and define the cardinal number for so-called 
      countable sets.
      Most of our examples will be subsets of some of our standard number systems such as 
      <m>\mathbb{N}</m>,
      <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>, and <m>\mathbb{Q}</m>.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Infinite Sets</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="PA_introtoinfinite">Beginning Activity 1</xref>,
      we saw how to use <xref ref="C_propersubsets"></xref>
      to prove that a set is infinite.
      This corollary implies that if <m>A</m> is a finite set,
      then <m>A</m> is not equivalent to any of its proper subsets.
      By writing the contrapositive of this conditional statement,
      we can restate <xref ref="C_propersubsets"></xref> in the following form:
    </p>
    <paragraphs>
      <title><xref ref="C_propersubsets"></xref> Restated</title>
    <p>
      If a set <m>A</m> is equivalent to one of its proper subsets,
      then <m>A</m> is infinite.
    </p>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="PA_introtoinfinite">Beginning Activity 1</xref>,
      we used <xref ref="C_propersubsets"></xref> to prove that
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The set of natural numbers, <m>\mathbb{N}</m>, is an infinite set.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The open interval <m>( 0, 1 )</m> is an infinite set.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Although <xref ref="C_propersubsets"></xref>
      provides one way to prove that a set is infinite,
      it is sometimes more convenient to use a proof by contradiction to prove that a set is infinite.
      The idea is to use results from <xref ref="S_finitesets"></xref>
      about finite sets to help obtain a contradiction.
      This is illustrated in the next theorem.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="T_subsetisinfinite">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be sets.

              <p>
                If <m>A</m> is infinite and <m>A \approx B</m>,

              </p>
            </li>
            <li xml:id="T_subsetisinfinite2">
              <p>
                If <m>A</m> is infinite and <m>A \subseteq B</m>,
                then <m>B</m> is infinite.
              </p>

          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    
    <proof>
      <p>
        We will prove <xref ref="T_subsetisinfinite1"/>.
        The proof of <xref ref="T_subsetisinfinite2"/> is
        <xref ref="exer_subsetisinfinite"></xref>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prove <xref ref="T_subsetisinfinite1"/>,
        we use a proof by contradiction and assume that <m>A</m> is an infinite set,
        <m>A \approx B</m>, and <m>B</m> is not infinite.
        That is, <m>B</m> is a finite set.
        Since <m>A \approx B</m> and <m>B</m> is finite,
        <xref ref="T_equivfinitesets"></xref>
        on <xref ref="T_equivfinitesets"></xref>
        implies that <m>A</m> is a finite set.
        This is a contradiction to the assumption that <m>A</m> is infinite.
        We have therefore proved that if <m>A</m> is infinite and <m>A \approx B</m>,
        then <m>B</m> is infinite.

    <title>Countably Infinite Sets</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="S_finitesets"></xref>,
      we used the set <m>\mathbb{N}_k</m> as the standard set with cardinality <m>k</m> in 
      the sense that a set is finite if and only if it is equivalent to <m>\mathbb{N}_k</m>.
      In a similar manner,
      we will use some infinite sets as standard sets for certain infinite cardinal numbers.
      The first set we will use is <m>\mathbb{N}</m>.

      We will formally define what it means to say the elements of a set can be
      <q>counted</q>
      using the natural numbers.
      The elements of a finite set can be
      <q>counted</q>
      by defining a bijection (one-to-one correspondence) between the set and
      <m>\mathbb{N}_k</m> for some natural number <m>k</m>.
      We will be able to

      the elements of an infinite set if we can define a one-to-one correspondence between the

    <p>
      The fact that the set of integers is a countably infinite set is important enough to be 
      called a theorem.
      The function we will use to establish that
      <m>\N \approx \Z</m> was explored in <xref ref="PA_functionNtoZ">Beginning Activity 2</xref>.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="T_ZequivtoN">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The set <m>\Z</m> of integers is countably infinite,
          and so <m>\text{ card} ( \Z ) = \aleph_0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    
    <proof>
      <p>
        To prove that <m>\N \approx \Z</m>,
        we will use the following function:
        <m>f\x \N \to \Z</m>, where
        <me>
          f ( n ) = \begin{cases}\dfrac{n}{2} \amp \text{ if \(n\) is even }  \\ \amp \\ \dfrac{1-n}{2} 
          \amp \text{ if \(n\) is odd } . \end{cases}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        From our work in <xref ref="PA_functionNtoZ">Beginning Activity 2</xref>,
        it appears that if <m>n</m> is an even natural number,
        then <m>f ( n ) > 0</m>,
        and if <m>n</m> is an odd natural number,
        then <m>f ( n ) \leq 0</m>.
        So it seems reasonable to use cases to prove that <m>f</m> is a surjection and that <m>f</m> is an injection.
        To prove that <m>f</m> is a surjection,
        we let <m>y \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>y > 0</m>, then <m>2y \in \mathbb{N}</m>, and
              <me>
                f ( 2y ) = \frac{2y}{2} = y
              </me>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>y \leq 0</m>,
              then <m>-2y \geq 0</m> and <m>1 - 2y</m> is an odd natural number.
              Hence,
              <me>
                f ( 1 - 2y ) = \frac{1 - (1 - 2y )}{2} = \frac{2y}{2}=y
              </me>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        These two cases prove that if <m>y \in \mathbb{Z}</m>,
        then there exists an <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m> such that
        <m>f ( n ) = y</m>.
        Hence, <m>f</m> is a surjection.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prove that <m>f</m> is an injection, we let
        <m>m,
        n \in \mathbb{N}</m> and assume that <m>f ( m ) = f ( n )</m>.
        First note that if one of <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> is odd and the other is even,
        then one of <m>f ( m )</m> and <m>f ( n )</m> is positive and the other is less than or 
        equal to 0.
        So if <m>f ( m ) = f ( n )</m>,
        then both <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> must be even or both <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> must be odd.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If both <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are even,
              then <me>f ( m ) = f ( n ) \text{ implies that }
              \dfrac{m}{2} = \dfrac{n}{2}</me> and hence that <m>m = n</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If both <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are odd,
              then <me>f ( m ) = f ( n ) \text{ implies that } \dfrac{1-m}{2} = \dfrac{1-n}{2}</me>.
              From this, we conclude that <m>1 - m</m> = <m>1 - n</m> and hence that <m>m = n</m>.
              This proves that if <m>f ( m ) = f ( n )</m>,
              then <m>m = n</m> and hence that <m>f</m> is an injection.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>f</m> is both a surjection and an injection,
        we see that <m>f</m> is a bijection and, therefore,
        <m>\mathbb{N} \approx \mathbb{Z}</m>.
        Hence, <m>\mathbb{Z}</m> is countably infinite and <m>\text{ card} ( \Z ) = \aleph_0</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>

    <p>
      The result in <xref ref="T_ZequivtoN"></xref> can seem a bit surprising.
      It exhibits one of the distinctions between finite and infinite sets.
      If we add elements to a finite set,
      we will increase its size in the sense that the new set will have a greater cardinality 
      than the old set.
      However, with infinite sets,
      we can add elements and the new set may still have the same cardinality as the original set.
      For example,
      there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the sets <m>\N</m> and <m>\Z</m>.
      We say that these sets have the same cardinality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following is a summary of some of the main examples dealing with the cardinality of sets 
      that we have explored.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The sets <m>\mathbb{N}_k</m>,
            where <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>,
            are examples of sets that are countable and finite.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The sets <m>\mathbb{N}</m>,
            <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>, the set of all odd natural numbers,
            and the set of all even natural numbers are examples of sets that are countable 
            and countably infinite.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We have not yet proved that any set is uncountable.

    <title>The Set of Positive Rational Numbers</title>
    <p>
      If we expect to find an uncountable set in our usual number systems,
      the rational numbers might be the place to start looking.
      One of the main differences between the set of rational numbers and the integers is that 
      given any integer <m>m</m>,
      there is a next integer, namely <m>m + 1</m>.
      This is not true for the set of rational numbers.
      We know that <m>\Q</m> is closed under division
      (by nonzero rational numbers)
      and we will see that this property implies that given any two rational numbers,
      we can also find a rational number between them.
      In fact, between any two rational numbers,
      we can find infinitely many rational numbers.
      It is this property that may lead us to believe that there are
      <q>more</q>
      rational numbers than there are integers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic idea will be to
      <q>go half way</q>
      between two rational numbers.
      For example,
      if we use <m>a = \dfrac{1}{3}</m> and <m>b = \dfrac{1}{2}</m>,
      we can use
      <me>
        \frac{a+b}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{5}{12}
      </me>
      as a rational number between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
      We can then repeat this process to find a rational number between
      <m>\dfrac{5}{12}</m> and <m>\dfrac{1}{2}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we will now let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be any two rational numbers with
      <m>a \lt  b</m> and let <m>c_1 = \dfrac{a+b}{2}</m>.
      We then see that
      <md>
        <mrow>c_1 - a \amp = \frac{a+b}{2} - a \amp   b- c_1 \amp = b - \frac{a+b}{2}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \frac{a+b}{2} - \frac{2a}{2} \amp   \amp = \frac{2b}{2} - \frac{a+b}{2}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \frac{b-a}{2}                \amp   \amp = \frac{b-a}{2}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>b > a</m>, we see that
      <m>b - a > 0</m> and so the previous equations show that
      <m>c_1 - a > 0</m> and <m>b - c_1 > 0</m>.
      We can then conclude that <m>a \lt c_1 \lt b</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can now repeat this process by using
      <m>c_2 = \dfrac{c_1 + b}{2}</m> and proving that <m>c_1 \lt  c_2 \lt  b</m>.
      In fact, for each natural number, we can define
      <me>
        c_{k + 1} = \frac{c_k + b}{2}
      </me>
      and obtain the result that
      <m>a \lt  c_1 \lt  c_2 \lt  \cdots \lt  c_n \lt  \cdots \lt  b</m> and this proves 
      that the set
      <m>\left\{ c_k \mid k \in \mathbb{N} \right\}</m> is a countably infinite set where 
      each element is a rational number between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. (A formal proof can be 
      completed using mathematical induction.) See <xref ref="exer_tworationals"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This result is true no matter how close together <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are.
      For example,
      we can now conclude that there are infinitely many rational numbers between 0 and 
      <m>\dfrac{1}{10000}</m>.
      This might suggest that the set
      <m>\mathbb{Q}</m> of rational numbers is uncountable.
      Surprisingly, this is not the case.
      We start with a proof that the set of positive rational numbers is countable.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="T_positiverationals">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The set of positive rational numbers is countably infinite.
        </p>
      </statement>
    
    <proof>
      <p>
        We can write all the positive rational numbers in a two-dimensional array as shown 
        in <xref ref="fig_positiverationals"></xref>.
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig_positiverationals">
        <caption>Counting the Positive Rational Numbers</caption>
        <image width="50%" source="figps-rationals.svg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The top row in <xref ref="fig_positiverationals"></xref>
        represents the numerator of the rational number,
        and the left column represents the denominator.
        We follow the arrows in <xref ref="fig_positiverationals"></xref>
        to define <m>f\x \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}^+</m>.
        The idea is to start in the upper left corner of the table and move to successive 
        diagonals as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              We start with all fractions in which the sum of the numerator and denominator is 2 
              <m>\left( \text{ only } \dfrac{1}{1} \right)</m>.
              So <m>f ( 1 ) = \dfrac{1}{1}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We next use those fractions in which the sum of the numerator and denominator is 3.
              So <m>f ( 2 ) = \dfrac{2}{1}</m> and <m>f ( 3 ) = \dfrac{1}{2}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We next use those fractions in which the sum of the numerator and denominator is 4.
              So <m>f ( 4 ) = \dfrac{1}{3}</m>,
              <m>f ( 5 ) = \dfrac{3}{1}</m>.
              We skipped <m>\dfrac{2}{2}</m> since <m>\dfrac{2}{2} = \dfrac{1}{1}</m>.
              In this way,
              we will ensure that the function <m>f</m> is a one-to-one function.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        We now continue with successive diagonals omitting fractions that are not in lowest terms.
        This process guarantees that the function <m>f</m> will be an injection and a surjection.
        Therefore, <m>\mathbb{N} \approx \mathbb{Q}^+</m> and <m>\text{ card} ( \mathbb{Q}^+ ) = \aleph_0</m>.

      see <xref ref="A_Qcountable"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>\mathbb{Q}^+</m> is countable,
      it seems reasonable to expect that <m>Q</m> is countable.
      We will explore this soon.
      On the other hand, at this point,
      it may also seem reasonable to ask,
      <q>Are there any uncountable sets?</q>
      The answer to this question is yes,
      but we will wait until the next section to prove that certain sets are uncountable.
      We still have a few more issues to deal with concerning countable sets.

      says that if we add a finite number of elements to a countably infinite set,
      the resulting set is still countably infinite.
      In other words,
      the cardinality of the new set is the same as the cardinality of the original set.
      Finite sets behave very differently in the sense that if we add elements to a finite set,
      we will change the cardinality.
      What may even be more surprising is the result in <xref ref="T_unionofcountable"></xref>
      that states that the union of two countably infinite (disjoint) sets is countably infinite.
      The proof of this result is similar to the proof that the integers are countably infinite
      (<xref ref="T_ZequivtoN"></xref>).
      In fact, if <m>A = \{a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots \}</m> and <m>B = \{b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots \}</m>,
      then we can use the following diagram to help define a bijection from <m>\N</m> to 
      <m>A \cup B</m>.

          <idx><h>countably infinite sets</h><h>subsets of</h></idx>
      In <xref ref="S_finitesets"></xref>,
      we proved that any subset of a finite set is finite
      (<xref ref="T_finitesubsets"></xref>).
      A similar result should be expected for countable sets.
      We first prove that every subset of <m>\mathbb{N}</m> is countable.
      For an infinite subset <m>B</m> of <m>\mathbb{N}</m>,
      the idea of the proof is to define a function
      <m>g\x \mathbb{N} \to B</m> by removing the elements from <m>B</m> from smallest to the 
      next smallest to the next smallest,
      and so on.
      We do this by defining the function <m>g</m> recursively as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Let <m>g ( 1 )</m> be the smallest natural number in <m>B</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Remove <m>g ( 1 )</m> from <m>B</m> and let <m>g ( 2 )</m> be the smallest natural 
            number in <m>B - \left\{ g ( 1 ) \right\}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Remove <m>g ( 2 )</m> and let <m>g ( 3 )</m> be the smallest natural number in 
            <m>B - \left\{ g ( 1 ), g ( 2 ) \right\}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We continue this process.
            The formal recursive definition of
            <m>g\x \mathbb{N} \to B</m> is included in the proof of 
            <xref ref="T_subsetsofN"></xref>.

        Let <m>B</m> be a subset of <m>\mathbb{N}</m>.
        If <m>B</m> is finite, then <m>B</m> is countable.
        So we next assume that <m>B</m> is infinite.
        We will next give a recursive definition of a function
        <m>g\x \mathbb{N} \to B</m> and then prove that <m>g</m> is a bijection.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Let <m>g ( 1 )</m> be the smallest natural number in <m>B</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For each <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>,
              the set <m>B - \left\{ g ( 1 ), g ( 2 ), \ldots,
              g ( n ) \right\}</m> is not empty since <m>B</m> is infinite.
              Define <m>g ( n + 1 )</m> to be the smallest natural number in 
              <m>B - \left\{ g ( 1 ), g ( 2 ), \ldots,

          To prove that <m>g</m> is an injection,

          if <m>r \ne s</m>, then <m>g ( r ) \ne g ( s )</m>.
          To do this, we may assume that <m>r \lt s</m> since one of the two numbers must be 
          less than the other.
          Then notice that <m>g ( r ) \in \left\{ g( 1 ), g( 2 ), \ldots,

          To prove that <m>g</m> is a surjection,
          let <m>b \in B</m> and notice that for some <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>,

      <title>Another Proof that <m>\mathbf{\Q^+}</m> Is Countable</title>

        <introduction>
          <p>
            For this activity,
            it may be helpful to use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
            (see <xref ref="T_fundtheorem"></xref>.
            Let <m>\Q^+</m> be the set of positive rational numbers.
            Every positive rational number has a unique representation as a fraction 
            <m>\dfrac{m}{n}</m>,
            where <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are relatively prime natural numbers.
            We will now define a function
          <m>f\x  \Q^+ \to \N</m> as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
            If
            <m>x \in \Q^+</m> and <m>x = \dfrac{m}{n}</m>, where
            <m>m,
            n \in \N</m>, <m>n \ne 1</m> and <m>\gcd(m, n) = 1</m>, we write
            <md>
              <mrow>m \amp = p_1^{\alpha_1} p_2^{\alpha_2} \cdots p_r^{\alpha_r}, \text{ and }</mrow>
              <mrow>n \amp = q_1^{\beta_1} q_2^{\beta_2} \cdots q_s^{\beta_s}</mrow>
            </md>,
            where <m>p_1</m>, <m>p_2</m>,
            <ellipsis/>, <m>p_r</m> are distinct prime numbers,
            <m>q_1</m>, <m>q_2</m>, <ellipsis/>,
            <m>q_s</m> are distinct prime numbers, and <m>\alpha_1</m>,
            <m>\alpha_2</m>, <ellipsis/>, <m>\alpha_r</m> and <m>\beta_1</m>,
            <m>\beta_2</m>, <ellipsis/>, <m>\beta_s</m> are natural numbers.
            We also write <m>1 = 2^0</m> when <m>m = 1</m>.
            We then define
            <me>
              f(x) = p_1^{2\alpha_1} p_2^{2\alpha_2} \cdots p_r^{2\alpha_r} q_1^{2\beta_1 -1 } 
              q_2^{2 \beta_2 - 1} \cdots q_s^{2 \beta_s - 1}
            </me>.
            If <m>x = \dfrac{m}{1}</m>,
            then we define <m>f(x) = p_1^{2\alpha_1} p_2^{2\alpha_2} \cdots p_r^{2\alpha_r} = m^2</m>.
