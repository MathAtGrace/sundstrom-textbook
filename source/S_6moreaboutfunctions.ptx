  <title>More about Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="S_introfunctions"></xref>,
      we have seen many examples of functions.
      We have also seen various ways to represent functions and to convey information about them.
      For example,
      we have seen that the rule for determining outputs of a function can be given by a formula,
      a graph, or a table of values.
      We have also seen that sometimes it is more convenient to give a verbal description of 
      the rule for a function.
      In cases where the domain and codomain are small, finite sets,
      we used an arrow diagram to convey information about how inputs and outputs are associated 
      without explicitly stating a rule.
      In this section, we will study some types of functions,
      some of which we may not have encountered in previous mathematics courses.

        A <term>polygon</term>

        is a line segment that connects two nonadjacent vertices of the polygon.
        In this activity, we will assume that all polygons are

        except for the vertices, each diagonal lies inside the polygon.

        a triangle (3-sided polygon) has no diagonals and a rectangle has two diagonals.

  <subsection xml:id="sub_functioncong">
    <title>Functions Involving Congruences</title>
    <p>
      <xref ref="T_congtorem"></xref>
      and <xref ref="C_congtorem"></xref>
      state that an integer is congruent
      (mod <m>n</m>)
      to its remainder when it is divided by <m>n</m>.
      (Recall that we always mean the remainder guaranteed by the Division Algorithm,
      which is the least nonnegative remainder.)
      Since this remainder is unique and since the only possible remainders for division by 
      <m>n</m> are <m>0, 1, 2,  \ldots , n - 1</m>,
      we then know that each integer is congruent, modulo <m>n</m>,
      to precisely one of the integers <m>0,1,2, \ldots ,n - 1</m>.
      So for each natural number <m>n</m>,
      we will define a new set <m>R_n</m> as the set of remainders upon division by <m>n</m>.
      So
      <me>
        R_n = \{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots , n - 1 \}
      </me>.

      For example,
      <m>R_4 = \{0, 1, 2, 3 \}</m> and <m>R_6 = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \}</m>.
      We will now explore a method to define a function from <m>R_6</m> to <m>R_6</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each <m>x \in R_6</m>,
      we can compute <m>x^2  + 3</m> and then determine the value of <m>r</m> in <m>R_6</m> so that
      <me>
        \left( {x^2  + 3} \right) \equiv r\pmod 6
      </me>.

      Since <m>r</m> must be in <m>R_6</m>,
      we must have <m>0 \leq r \lt 6</m>.
      The results are shown in the following table.

      This description and the notation for the outputs of this function are quite cumbersome.
      So we will use a more concise notation.
      We will, instead, write Let
      <me>f\x R_6 \to R_6 \text{ by } f( x ) = \left( {x^2 + 3} \right) \pmod 6</me>.

    <title>Equality of Functions</title>
    <p>
      The idea of equality of functions has been in the background of our discussion of functions,
      and it is now time to discuss it explicitly.
      The preliminary work for this discussion was <xref text="custom" ref="PA_diagonals">Beginning Activity 1</xref>,
      in which <m>D = \mathbb{N} - \left\{ {1, 2} \right\}</m>,
      and there were two functions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>d\x D \to \mathbb{N} \cup \left\{ 0 \right\}</m>,
            where <m>d( n )</m> is the number of diagonals of a convex polygon with <m>n</m> sides
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f\x \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}</m>,
            where <m>f( x ) = \dfrac{{x\left( {x - 3} \right)}}{2}</m>,
            for each real number <m>x</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In <xref text="custom" ref="PA_diagonals">Beginning Activity 1</xref>,
      we saw that these two functions produced the same outputs for certain values of the input
      (independent variable).
      For example, we can verify that
      <md>
        <mrow>d( 3 ) \amp = f( 3 ) = 0, \qquad \amp d( 4 ) = f( 4 ) = 2,</mrow>
        <mrow>d( 5 ) \amp = f( 5 ) = 5, \qquad \text{ and }   \amp d( 6 ) = f( 6 ) = 9</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the functions produce the same outputs for some inputs,
      these are two different functions.
      For example,
      the outputs of the function <m>f</m> are determined by a formula,
      and the outputs of the function <m>d</m> are determined by a verbal description.
      This is not enough,
      however, to say that these are two different functions.
      Based on the evidence from <xref text="custom" ref="PA_diagonals">Beginning Activity 1</xref>,
      we might make the following conjecture: 
      <blockquote>
        For <m>n \geq 3</m>,
        <m>d( n ) = \dfrac{{n\left( {n - 3} \right)}}{2}</m>.
      </blockquote>
      Although we have not proved this statement, it is a true statement.
      (See <xref ref="exer_sec62-6"></xref>.)
      However, we know the function <m>d</m> and the function <m>f</m> are not the same function.
      For example,
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f( 0 ) = 0</m>, but 0 is not in the domain of <m>d</m>;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f( \pi ) = \dfrac{{\pi \left( {\pi - 3} \right)}}{2}</m>,
            but <m>\pi</m> is not in the domain of <m>d</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      We thus see the importance of considering the domain and codomain of each of the two functions in determining whether the two functions are equal or not.
      This motivates the following definition.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="functionequality">

    <title>Mathematical Processes as Functions</title>
    <p>
      Certain mathematical processes can be thought of as functions.
      In <xref text="custom" ref="PA_derivatives">Beginning Activity 2</xref>,
      we reviewed how to find the derivatives of certain functions,
      and we considered whether or not we could think of this differentiation process as a function.
      If we use a differentiable function as the input and consider the derivative of that function to be the output,
      then we have the makings of a function.
      Computer algebra systems such as
      <pubtitle>Maple</pubtitle> and <pubtitle>Mathematica</pubtitle>
      have this derivative function as one of their predefined operators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Different computer algebra systems will have different syntax for entering functions 
      and for the derivative function.
      The first step will be to input a real function <m>f</m>.
      This is usually done by entering a formula for <m>f(x)</m>,
      which is valid for all real numbers <m>x</m> for which <m>f(x)</m> is defined.
      The next step is to apply the derivative function to the function <m>f</m>.
      For purposes of illustration,
      we will use <m>D</m> to represent this derivative function.
      So this function will give <m>D(f) = f'</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if we enter
      <me>
        f(x) = x^2 \sin (x)
      </me>
      for the function <m>f</m>, we will get <me>D(f) = f',
      \text{ where } f'(x) = 2x\sin \left( x \right) + x^2 \cos \left( x \right)</me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must be careful when determining the domain for the derivative function since there 
      are functions that are not differentiable.
      To make things reasonably easy,
      we will let <m>F</m> be the set of all real functions that are differentiable and call 
      this the domain of the derivative function <m>D</m>.
      We will use the set <m>T</m> of all real functions as the codomain.
      So our function <m>D</m> is
      <me>
        D\x F \to T  \text{ by }  D( f ) = f'
      </me>.

    <title>Sequences as Functions</title>
    <p>
      A sequence can be considered to be an infinite list of objects that are indexed 
      (subscripted) by the natural numbers
      (or some infinite subset of <m>\mathbb{N} \cup \left\{ 0 \right\}</m>).
      Using this idea, we often write a sequence in the following form:
      <me>
        a_1 , a_2 ,  \ldots , a_n ,  \ldots
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to shorten our notation,
      we will often use the notation
      <m>\left\langle {a_n } \right\rangle</m> to represent this sequence.
      Sometimes a formula can be used to represent the terms of a sequence,
      and we might include this formula as the <m>n</m>th term in the list for a sequence such 
      as in the following example:
      <me>
        1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3},  \ldots , \frac{1}{n},  \ldots
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case,
      the <m>n^\text{ th }</m> term of the sequence is <m>\dfrac{1}{n}</m>.
      If we know a formula for the <m>n</m>th term,
      we often use this formula to represent the sequence.
      For example,
      we might say Define the sequence <m>\left\langle {a_n } \right\rangle</m> by
      <m>a_n  = \dfrac{1}{n}</m> for each <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>.
      This shows that this sequence is a function with domain <m>\mathbb{N}</m>.
      If it is understood that the domain is <m>\N</m>,
      we could refer to this as the sequence <m>\left\langle \dfrac{1}{n} \right \rangle</m>.
      Given an element of the domain,
      we can consider <m>a_n</m> to be the output.
      In this case,
      we have used subscript notation to indicate the output rather than the usual function notation.
      We could just as easily write
      <me>
        a( n ) = \frac{1}{n} \text{ instead of }  a_n  = \frac{1}{n}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We make the following formal definition.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="sequence">

    <title>Functions of Two Variables</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="S_cartesian"></xref>,
      we learned how to form the Cartesian product of two sets.
      Recall that a Cartesian product of two sets is a set of ordered pairs.
      For example,
      the set <m>\Z \times \Z</m> is the set of all ordered pairs,
      where each coordinate of an ordered pair is an integer.
      Since a Cartesian product is a set,
      it could be used as the domain or codomain of a function.
      For example,
      we could use <m>\Z \times \Z</m> as the domain of a function as follows: Let
      <m>f\x \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}</m> be defined by 
      <m>f( {m, n} ) = 2m + n</m>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Technically,
            an element of  <m>\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}</m>  is an ordered pair,
            and so we should write  <m>f( {( {m, n} )} )</m> for the output of the function 
            <m>f</m>   when the input is  the ordered pair <m>\left( {m, n} \right)</m>.
            However, the double parentheses seem unnecessary in this context and there should be no confusion if we write
            <m>f( {m, n} )</m> for the output of the function  <m>f</m>   when the input is 
            <m>\left( {m, n} \right)</m>.
            So, for example, we simply write
            <md>
              <mrow>f( {3, 2} )    \amp = 2 \cdot 3 + 2 = 8,\text{ and }</mrow>
              <mrow>f( { - 4, 5} ) \amp = 2 \cdot \left( { - 4} \right) + 5 =  - 3</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Since the domain of this function is <m>\Z \times \Z</m> and each element of
            <m>\Z \times \Z</m> is an ordered pair of integers,
            we frequently call this type of function a
            <term>function of two variables</term>.
              <idx><h>function</h><h>of two variables</h></idx>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding the preimages of an element of the codomain for the function <m>f</m>,
      <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>,
      usually involves solving an equation with two variables.
      For example, to find the preimages of <m>0 \in \mathbb{Z}</m>,
      we need to find all ordered pairs
      <m>\left( {m, n} \right) \in \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}</m> such that 
      <m>f( {m, n} ) = 0</m>.
      This means that we must find all ordered pairs 
      <m>\left( {m, n} \right) \in \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}</m> such that
      <me>
        2m + n = 0
      </me>.
 
      Three such ordered pairs are <m>\left( {0, 0} \right)</m>,
      <m>\left( {1,  - 2} \right)</m>,
      and <m>\left( { - 1, 2} \right)</m>.
      In fact, whenever we choose an integer value for <m>m</m>,
      we can find a corresponding integer <m>n</m> such that <m>2m + n = 0</m>.
      This means that 0 has infinitely many preimages,
      and it may be difficult to specify the set of all of the preimages of 0 using the 
      roster method.
      One way that can be used to specify this set is to use set builder notation and say that 
      the following set consists of all of the preimages of 0:
      <me>
        \left\{ { {\left( {m, n} \right) \in \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} } \mid 2m + n = 0} 
        \right\} = \left\{ { {\left( {m, n} \right) \in \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} } \mid n 
        =  - 2m} \right\}\!
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second formulation for this set was obtained by solving the equation
      <m>2m + n = 0</m> for <m>n</m>.

          In <xref text="custom" ref="PA_diagonals">Beginning Activity 1</xref>,
          we showed that for values of <m>n</m> from  3 through 8,

            d( n ) = \frac{{n\left( {n - 3} \right)}}{2}

      <hint>
        <p>
          To get an idea of how to handle the inductive step,
          use a pentagon.
          First, form all the diagonals that can be made from  four  of the vertices.
          Then consider how to make new diagonals when the fifth vertex is used.
          This may generate an idea of how to proceed from a polygon with <m>k</m> sides to a 
          polygon with <m>k + 1</m> sides.
        </p>
      </hint>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Start of the inductive step:  Let <m>P ( n )</m> be
          <q>A convex polygon with <m>n</m> sides has <m>\dfrac{n ( n-3 )}{2}</m> diagonals.</q>
          Let <m>k \in D</m> and assume that <m>P ( k )</m> is true, that is, a convex polygon 
          with <m>k</m> sides has <m>\dfrac{{k( {k - 3} )}}{2}</m> diagonals. Now let 
           <m>Q</m> be convex polygon with <m>( {k + 1} )</m> sides. Let <m>v</m> be one of the 
           <m>( {k + 1} )</m> vertices of <m>Q</m>  and let <m>u</m> and <m>w</m>  be the two 
           vertices adjacent to  <m>v</m>. By drawing the line segment from <m>u</m> to <m>w</m> 
           and omitting the vertex  <m>v</m>, we form a convex polygon with <m>k</m> sides.  
           Now complete the inductive step.

      <title>Integration as a Function</title>

      <introduction>
        <p>
          In calculus,
          we learned that if <m>f</m> is real function that is continuous on the closed interval 
          <m>\left[ {a, b} \right]</m>,
          then the definite integral <m>\int_a^b {f( x ) \, dx}</m> is a real number.
          In fact, one form of the <term>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</term>
            <idx><h>Fundamental Theorem</h><h>of Calculus</h></idx>
          states that
          <me>
            \int_a^b {f( x ) \, dx} = F( b ) - F( a )
          </me>,
          where <m>F</m> is any antiderivative of <m>f</m>,
          that is, where  <m>F \,' = f</m>.

          Let <m>\left[ {a, b} \right]</m> be a closed interval of real numbers and let

          on <m>\left[ {a, b} \right]</m>.

        <conclusion>
          <p>
            In calculus,
            we also learned how to determine the indefinite integral
            <m>\int {f( x )} \;dx</m> of a continuous function  <m>f</m>.
          </p>
        </conclusion>
      </task>
      <task>
        <p>
          Let <m>f( x ) = x^2 + 1</m> and <m>g(x) = \cos( 2x )</m>.
          Determine <m>\int {f( x )} \;dx</m> and <m>\int {g( x )} \;dx</m>.
        </p>
      </task>
      <task>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be a continuous function on the closed interval
          <m>\left[ {0, 1} \right]</m> and let <m>T</m> be the set of all real functions.
          Can the process of determining the indefinite integral of a continuous function be 
          used to define a function from <m>C{\left[ {0, 1} \right]}</m> to <m>T</m>?
          Explain.
        </p>
      </task>
      <task>
        <p>
          Another form of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that if <m>f</m> is 
          continuous on the interval <m>\left[ {a, b} \right]</m> and if
          <me>
            g( x ) = \int_a^x {f( t ) \, dt}
          </me>
          for each <m>x</m> in <m>\left[ {a, b} \right]</m>,
          then <m>g'\left( x \right) = f\left( x \right)</m>.
          That is, <m>g</m> is an antiderivative of <m>f</m>.
          Explain how this theorem can be used to define a function from 
          <m>C{\left[ {a,\;b} \right]}</m> to <m>T</m>,
          where the output of the function is an antiderivative of the input.
          (Recall that <m>T</m> is the set of all real functions.)
